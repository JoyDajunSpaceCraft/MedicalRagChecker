When I was in my teens it was once every few months and I would treat with monastat 1. When monastat 1 stopped working I moved one to monastat 3. Then 5. Then 7. Then it stopped being effective all together. After monastat stopped working I would go the the gyno to have her prescribe me antibiotics. I can't remember what she would prescribe, but it worked and I wouldn't have a yeast infection for a few months until it came back. I started coming in so frequently for the problem with no long term solution, eventually my doctor yelled at me for coming back for the same problem so often, told me to tell my boyfriend to clean his penis better (had no boyfriend at the time) and gave me the roughest pap smear I've ever had. I never went back. \nI switched doctors when I was 20 to this lovely amazing women who was determined to find a long term solution for me. She gave so much information and I followed all of her advice. After 2 appointments with her, she prescribed me fluconazole to take on day one, then 3 days later. She also gave me 4 refills at a time so I wouldn't have to go to the doctor everytime I had a yeast infection since they were so frequent and I could tell when I was getting one easily. Unfortunately that doctor died in a plane crash before we could find a solution. \nI was given a new doctor (male) in the same practice who is nice, and took over the prescription refill for the fluconazole. He told me he wanted to try a preventative method and I took fluconazole once a week for 6 months. I noticed in the last 2 months of treatment I had a very minor yeast infection, not bad enough for me to be in major discomfort, but noticeable. \nThat's where I am now. The 6 month preventative treatment is done, I'm worried to make an appointment with my doctor because I'm afraid that he won't have an answer. I'm just tired of trying so many different things with no results. Over the span of 12 years I've tried changing soaps (for my vagina), using no soap, using baby wash (what I use currently) and using feminine wash. I've changed my diet (no added sugar, no bread). I wear only cotton underwear and sleep without underwear or bottoms. \nAt this point I'm just worried that I'm resistant to the antibiotics I'm taking, and since I have no kids and want to, I'm worried if this will affect it. And I know that yeast infections are more common in pregnant women, what if by the time get pregnant get an uncurable yeast infection? \n\nSO my question is, has anyone had any experience personally or with patients that this happened? Is there a new treatment I should talk to my doctor about or something I can try personally? Any advice would be appreciated. \nThanks for reading \n\nTLDR; frequent yeast infections for the last 12 years with no long term solution after trying multiple things.

I’m of normal weight (about 67 kg) and my height is 176 cm. I don’t drink, smoke or use drugs. I’m on is 40 mg nexium and been on that since April but been using PPIs since October 2014.\n\nProblem is that I can’t eat anything without having constant moderate - severe stomach discomfort, tightness, lots of gas, feeling of needing to have a bowel movement. I am also experiencing slight fecal incontinence which is worse after bowel movements.\n\nI can’t eat anything without this happening, I’ve been on many diets without relief. I noticed that the stomach tightness disappears when I have forgotten to take my medication and my stomach just feels better. This is the only thing that makes me feel better, not being on medication. Problem is that if I’m not on any medication, I will have severe reflux no matter what I eat. I explained this to the doctors but they are a bit skeptical and told me that this shouldn’t happen, that nexium shouldn’t do this. Yet not being on medication seems to help. I tried being on H2 blockers but I don’t get relief from the stomach symptoms, I only get relief when I’m not using PPIs / H2 blockers at all. So my plan is to do surgery (LINX or nissen) so that I can come off my medication.\n\nI have had a lot of tests but everything is normal: \nGastroscopy (with biopsies) and colonoscopy (biopsies taken only of ileum), ultrasound and MRI of abdomen, CT of small intestines, digestive enzyme tests, liver function tests, test for small bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), allergy tests, celiac disease test, stool samples to test for parasites, etc. It’s all normal. Only thing is that I have an anal fissure that isn’t disappearing even after using steroids for a week and an unexplained very high rheumatoid factor (624). Also have a small hiatal hernia.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) How can acid reducing medications make me feel this much worse?\n\n2) What other possible explanation is there?\n\n3) Could constantly sucking in one’s gut for years limit the amount of oxygen or blood flow that is distributed to the stomach or body and thus cause these troublesome symptoms?

She sleeps a lot and never seems well rested when she wakes up. She'll wake up in the morning, go to turn her light on and then stand there, then turn her light back off and go back to bed. Her naps have been much longer than usual.\n-She has issues swinging. She starts to look unwell, sometimes holds her head and asks to get out. I'm assuming she's getting dizziness but I am not certain.\n-She's squinting and sometimes she runs into walls like she can't balance or her depth perception is off. This doesn't happen all the time.

My 15 year old (asian female) cousin passed away two days ago, who was completely a normal healthy teenager--no drugs, no smoking, no drinking, nothing. \n\nTwo weeks ago, her friend at school gave her a treat where she suddenly had an allergic reaction with her airways closing up and received three shots to control her allergic reaction. Apparently she had an allergic reaction to peanuts--something she was never allergic to before. She felt better, but then picked up mono from school probably a week later. She was saying she felt tired all the time and that her senses were all out of wack. Within that two week period she ended up in the ER again, first time for fatigue but was sent home and was told that the fatigue was from mono and that it would pass. \n\nThe second time to the ER was worse--this time she was airlifted to one of the best hospitals in the country but no one could figure out what was wrong, except only that her health was declining fast. Her liver was no longer functioning, hundreds of tests were performed and the only thing that came back positive was mono. Her brain swelled up so bad that it herniated to her spine causing her to lose all body function and at that point lost all brain activity. The only thing keeping her alive was epinephrine, two other drugs and life support. She died 24 hours later where family and friends were notified to come visit to say goodbye.\n\nThe family has agreed to an autopsy but we are devasted on how sudden and fast her health deteriorated so quickly and are at a loss of how this was not prevented. Any medical advice on what may have happened from experienced medical professionals would be greatly appreciated as we are all looking for answers... How does she go from a complete healthy vibrant teenager to having liver failure and losing her life in such a short period?\n\nMy uncle's family of four (aunt, uncle, 20 y/o son, and 15   y/o daughter) is now a family of two.

She told us if she has inflammation in her ear it will go away with time, but there is no test she can perform to prove that's what's wrong and she also didn't seem convinced that was the cause. She ordered an MRI of the spine. I also have an eye doctor appointment scheduled for next month.

She moves very slow and spaces out a lot. Almost like she's intoxicated. She acted this way last time she had a high fever, but she doesn't have a fever.\n-Very tired. She sleeps a lot and never seems well rested when she wakes up. She'll wake up in the morning, go to turn her light on and then stand there, then turn her light back off and go back to bed. Her naps have been much longer than usual.\n-She has issues swinging. She starts to look unwell, sometimes holds her head and asks to get out. I'm assuming she's getting dizziness but I am not certain.\n-She's squinting and sometimes she runs into walls like she can't balance or her depth perception is off. This doesn't happen all the time. Some days she's better.\n-I may have seen involuntary movement with her tongue and sometimes I think she has issues swallowing water. She'll swallow a lot of air which seems weird.\n-She seems to be worse after waking up. Especially the loopiness.\n\nWhat on earth could be going on with my baby?

I’ve done all the obvious things and visited my dentist to try and get help but he doesn’t think the issue is from my mouth. I have very good dental hygiene, floss, brush twice, use mouthwash and a tongue scraper but it’s doesn’t help with the halitosis. The dentist says my teeth and gums are in very good shape and I have no pain whatsoever, in fact I haven’t had any issue with my teeth ever because I’m so religious about dental hygiene. I have a white tongue but scraping it does nothing, and the color varies from thick white to almost pinkish, but the pattern doesn’t change. \n\nHe recommended I go to a doctor to check out if the issue originates from my gut/intestines. I was diagnosed with crohns disease about 3-4 years ago but when I asked my doctor if halitosis is a side effect of it, he said that neither it or the medication I’m on can be the cause. I’ve had halitosis since before my diagnosis and before I started taking any medication. I’m not taking any antibiotics. My doctor did however order an upper endoscopy and I don’t have Gastroesophageal reflux disease but he doesn’t know what else it could be and I’ve gotten no further help. \n\nI have tried everything I could find on the internet, I’m taking probiotics, I’ve tried the candida diet, currently I’m cutting out sugars, caffeine, red meat and all preservative foods. I’ve seen no improvements. \n\nI’m going back to the doctor again next week but I’m hoping I could get some help on here if anyone has seen a similar case and suspects what it could be. This has been a nightmare for me and has had a horrible effect on my social life and I can’t wait to get rid of it.\n\nAnswer:\nBased on the provided context, it seems that the user's halitosis may not be related to their dental hygiene or Crohn's disease. The dentist has ruled out any oral causes, and the user has tried various dietary changes and probiotics without success. The user's doctor has suggested that the halitosis may be related to their gut/intestines, but has not been able to identify a specific cause.

Extract all factual claims from the given answer.\nQuestion:\nI am a 27 year old female, soon to be 28 and for the past 10-9 years I have been experiencing gradual loss in my memory. At first I ignored it as did my doctor saying it was due to stress, anxiety, and depression but it has come to a point where my memory loss is severely impacting my ability to learn new things. I have also noticed that my cognitive abilities have steadily declined. I am thinking of going either for a masters (Data and Comp Sci) or a second bachelor's in engineering and this is alarmingly affecting my ability to do things.\n\nI used to have lazer focus and that has declined. I used to be able to read books in one sitting. Now, I would read a sentence in a book and not understand what I just read because I couldn't remember important details. When I read books (fiction and nonfiction) I used to remember the detail such as the names, important scenes etc so I can summarize later what happened in the story but that has become impossible. I also noticed that I am not learning new words which used to be something that I loved doing.\n\nWhen I am having conversations, I find myself asking the same question over and over again now.\n\nI used to remember faces well but that has stopped as well. This one day, I was in a college club and I met this guy. We talked for a little bit and when I ran into him a few days later again in college, I didn't recognize him at all until he said that we met and talked at the college club.\n\nSomething that has really alarmed me is muscle memory loss. When I do something over and over, say cutting a vegetable, I noticed that I would become faster as I spend more time doing it. And I would do things automatically, like breathing, but that has stopped as well.\n\nI have noticed that when I bend my thumb sometimes, it shakes. Not always, but sometimes.\n\nI also have a hard time distinguishing between faces, something that wasn't an issue for me.\n\nI have a hard time distinguishing between similar things now which wasn't an issue for me before.\n\nI used to be very good at recognizing places. I would remember the places I have been to when I am walking through the place again. That has stopped as well. I don't remember or recognize houses places that I have been past two to three times.\n\nI would remember the things that happened during the day. But now it's more like faint patches and I can't recall details fast and well.\n\nI used to be good at playing board games. Learning new rules to play a new board game is hard now because I forget the rules.\n\nI had really bad sleep hygiene, eating habits in late HS and college and I thought that was the problem. I have been working on eating healthy, having a routine, getting 8 hours of restful sleep. I exercise daily. I was very social and became lonely in HS and college. I have been working on becoming more social as well.\n\nThese things have improved my situation a little but hasn't made a significant impact. It has been two years since I made these changes.\n\nI feel confused a lot.\n\nI have made an appointment with a neurologist. I had an MRI done and the doctor said there was nothing. Bloodwork also came out normal.\n\nI have had low blood pressure and cold hands and feet since I was 14. My doc told me to eat salt when BP is low. I also have clammy skin. \n\nDo you think oxygen therapy (hyperbaric oxygen) will improve my situation if I have brain damage or something?\n\nAnswer:\nI don't know.\n\nReturn a JSON list like: [\"claim1\", \"claim2\", ...]", "output": "[]"}

{"instruction": "You are a research assistant. Extract all factual claims from the given answer.\nQuestion:\nThis is going to be long, so thank you in advance for your patience. If there is a more suitable subreddit for me to post this in, please let me know.\n\nI am a 59 year old female. Currently 5’8” , 168 lbs. I never got my period as a young girl, and the combination of my mother being really Catholic and not prone to seeing doctors unless it was an emergency made my “condition” not really discussed or worried about, since it was an awkward subject. But I spent my entire adolescence wondering why I didn’t menstruate like the other girls, and feeling very left out and different. I did develop secondary sex characteristics, but I would give myself a IV on the Tanner scale. I also remember getting hot flashes when I was about 12 or 13 and didn’t understand what was happening.\n\nBy the time I was a senior in college, I had my first serious boyfriend and became sexually active. Even though I didn’t get my period, I was afraid I still might somehow get pregnant and went to the campus gynecologist for birth control. He was concerned about the reason for the primary amenorrhea and ordered a karyotype test. He told me how expensive it was and said since I had medical insurance as a college student this was the time to do it.\n\nI remember it was quite a long time afterwards, I was already out of college by the time I heard anything. He called me and told me I would not be able to have children and I should have my ovaries removed because there was a chance they could become malignant. I don’t recall him ever giving me a name for what was wrong with me, or explaining what my karyotype test said. I never got a written test result. The call was somewhat shocking to me, and I know I didn’t really hear everything he said that day. And now almost 40 years later I remember even less.\n\nI went through a lot of my younger life without medical insurance and I never had regular gynecological care. By my mid 30s I began yearly physicals, but my GP at the time didn’t make a big issue about my lack of periods. He said since I had some breast development I had enough estrogen in my system to protect against osteoporosis. Eventually I began to see a gynecologist and she encouraged me to see if I could find the results of that karyotype test, but too much time had passed and the records were destroyed. She ordered a transvaginal ultrasound and it was discovered that I had streak ovaries. I have had DEXA scans that show osteopenia, and I took Evista for 10 years without it having much effect, so I stopped the Evista and just take calcium and vitamin D supplements and do weight bearing exercise now.\n\nI guess what I am seeking is if there is any way I can gather more clues about my condition without doing another karyotype test. At my age I can’t imagine my insurance approving the test, since there is no real purpose for me having it done, except for my own closure. My current GP and gynecologist both seem unconcerned with my condition. As a matter of fact, the PA at the gynecologist’s office regularly still asks me for the date of my last period. I have to explain each time that I don’t even have functioning ovaries. What if I had one of those genetic tests done like 23 and Me...is it possible that they could determine anomalies with my sex chromosomes? I am so sorry this was so long. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this.\n\nEdited to add:\nMy physical appearance might be helpful in giving some clues. I am slim hipped and small-breasted; I am shaped more like a toilet paper roll than an hourglass but I look unmistakably female. My ring fingers are both about 1cm longer than my index fingers. (I know that factor has some bearing on difference between the sexes.) I have no unusual characteristics, but my arms are quite long, my fingers are long and my shoulders just a little bit on the broad side. My feet are large also. I used to be tall and thin (5’9” 135lbs) as a younger person, but I never was petite.\n\nAnswer:\nI don't know.\n\nReturn a JSON list like: [\"claim1\", \"claim2\", ...]", "output": "[]"}

Extract all factual claims from the given answer.\nQuestion:\nMy mother is losing her ability to speak and I don’t know what to do\n\nThis has been going on for two years and started off by me and my sibling noticing her voice starting to change. Fast forward two years and my moms ability to speak is almost entirely gone, and gotten worse in the past two months particularly.\n\nIt’s sounds like she is a baby or younger person and causes heavy sluring, essentially she’s lost all articulation and speed. Her mental ability is still 100% there, we’ve done multiple tests for memory, etc and she comes up in the higher percentiles for her age.\n\nShe writes me detailed letters that demonstrate her cognitive ability, no mental illness in the family.\n\nShe is 58, exercises daily (since college) and only eats healthy food. No smoking or drinking.\n\nShe is on the fifth doctor (CA) and they are starting from square 0 again with tests for ALS, dementia, etc.. but I have a feeling after another 6 months of testing we will find inconclusive results once again. As we have with all doctors (nobody can find what’s wrong).\n\nEDIT: a (belived urine, will confirm when know) test for rare micro toxins that were detected, my mother testing in the range of 608 ng/g for Mycophenolic  Acid, where the acceptable rate is roughly \\~38. Please see this comment for more discussion on this:  [\n\nThere’s is nothing that has changed mentally for my mother outside the newly added stress (she is on disability for work because her job requires talking) but I’m loosing my mind watching my mother lose her ability to talk, and I don’t know what to do or where to look. All the tests she passes and I just don’t know I just want hear her voice again.\n\nWhat can I do to get to the bottom of this? We’ve spent so much on these studies that show up inconclusive, nobody is giving me solid advice, every doctor wants to test the same things again (which I understand as its due process), but I need to figure this out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ***********  Updates  *************\n\nMy mom first noticed her ability to speak leaving in 2017, this \"illness\" has been a gradual climb since then and is now rapidly accelerating into her not being able to speak anymore. She can barely communicate for 2-3hrs of the day at the moment and this number is dwindling.\n\nShe has/is attempting western medicine solutions, we are on a long chain of specialists and referrals that started around late 2017.\n\nShe also believes in trying homeopathic/eastern medicine options, hence the long list of supplements.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns is the high level of Mycophenolic  Acid that appeared in my mothers urine samples. She was not tested for Mycophenolic acid until after she had been on her supplements for roughly six-eight months, she started the supplements early 2019.\n\nShe moved homes in 2018, the home she moved into was torn down to the foundation (by her) and rebuilt (this process **finished** in 2018), before moving in the home was checked for mold and no results came back. I have a theory that her furniture could have accumulated mold (all her main furniture sat in storage during the remodel).\n\nWhat I'm trying to do:\n\n\\- Make her condition and known results publicly and easily accessible by you guys\n\n\\- Forwarding all questions to her and recording all responses\n\n\\- Sending love to my mother\n\nWe plan on having the house re-checked for mold and will be moving her out temporarily in hopes that her condition improves (hoping that this is the cause of all this).\n\n**Please see edit 3 for the newest test results**\n\n# EDIT 2:\n\nThis is round one of information that I received, more will be incoming throughout the day when she finishes her swallow study today.\n\nAll symptoms are on the left side of throat/jaw/mouth\n\n**Tests:**\n\n* brain MRI in May 2019 was normal.\n* DAT scan for Parkinsons and PSP was normal in May 2019\n* EMG nerve test for ALS in April, 2019 was normal\n* Nuero psych exam in May 2020 normal\n* MRI of abdomen shows subcapsular cysts on spleen and thoracic roots\n* MRI of neck shows osteocytes on C 5,6\n* Abnormal blood tests are:\n* elevated ANA antibody\n* chronic past EBV infection-high titers\n* chronic low Vitamin D levels\n* Mycotoxin of Ochratoxin A and Mycophelonic acid\n* Heavy metals: Mercury, lead and arsenic.

I’ve seen multiple docs and had extensive bloodwork but I still cannot figure out what’s wrong with me. \n\nI have spells come on that start faintly, and grow to be so strong that I fear I’ll pass out or something. It happens a lot (read: maybe 6-7 spells this year?) and it’s newish, maybe 1-2ish years for me. \n\nSymptoms:\n\nDizzy (extremely)\n\nNauseous\n\nLightheaded (sometimes confused though rarely)\n\nHeadache\n\nExcessive sweating\n\nShaking hands\n\nTremor in one finger \n\nPuking\n\nDiarrhea\n\nHeadache\n\nDifficulty sleeping \n\nExcessive and frequent bruising (only during the time I’m having the spell. I’ll have like 3-4 Black bruises and won’t know why. Sometimes along my fingertips, sometimes elsewhere).\n\n\nSometimes I also notice a stutter but I wonder if it’s just my nervousness or something.\n\n\n\nIt all seems minor when you read the symptoms, or maybe you’d think “passing virus”, but I don’t think it explains the bruising or the fact that it happens every 1-2 months. The spells last around 10 days. \n\nAlso, sorry this is long but thought potentially related. In 2013 i was having similar spells where I was extremely confused and had difficulty speaking, along with other stuff. I had strokes and epilepsy ruled out and ultimately no answers. But a brain scan did reveal a harmless mass of either cells or something in my basal ganglia. I’ll dig up the wording, sorry. Also an enlarged pituitary but I had a miscarriage a week later so that probably explains that. I didn’t get follow up scans.\nEdit to add- going back to my doctor to ask again on Monday. Hoping for more guidance from her.\n\n\nAnother edit:\n\nWhen my daughter was born 15 months ago I was hospitalized and diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy. BP 210/110 and HR of 40 they couldn’t elevate for days. They walked it back since my heart wasn’t enlarged, but Ive had tons of episodes since then. First it felt like I had high BP also but my BP feels fine these times for the most part. But I’ve been having it since her birth 1 year ago. Echo, all heart stuff, enzymes all fine.

{"instruction": "You are a research assistant. Extract all factual claims from the given answer.\nQuestion:\nMy mother is losing her ability to speak and I don’t know what to do\n\nThis has been going on for two years and started off by me and my sibling noticing her voice starting to change. Fast forward two years and my moms ability to speak is almost entirely gone, and gotten worse in the past two months particularly.\n\nIt’s sounds like she is a baby or younger person and causes heavy sluring, essentially she’s lost all articulation and speed. Her mental ability is still 100% there, we’ve done multiple tests for memory, etc and she comes up in the higher percentiles for her age.\n\nShe writes me detailed letters that demonstrate her cognitive ability, no mental illness in the family.\n\nShe is 58, exercises daily (since college) and only eats healthy food. No smoking or drinking.\n\nShe is on the fifth doctor (CA) and they are starting from square 0 again with tests for ALS, dementia, etc.. but I have a feeling after another 6 months of testing we will find inconclusive results once again. As we have with all doctors (nobody can find what’s wrong).\n\nEDIT: a (belived urine, will confirm when know) test for rare micro toxins that were detected, my mother testing in the range of 608 ng/g for Mycophenolic  Acid, where the acceptable rate is roughly \\~38. Please see this comment for more discussion on this:  [\n\nThere’s is nothing that has changed mentally for my mother outside the newly added stress (she is on disability for work because her job requires talking) but I’m loosing my mind watching my mother lose her ability to talk, and I don’t know what to do or where to look. All the tests she passes and I just don’t know I just want hear her voice again.\n\nWhat can I do to get to the bottom of this? We’ve spent so much on these studies that show up inconclusive, nobody is giving me solid advice, every doctor wants to test the same things again (which I understand as its due process), but I need to figure this out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ***********  Updates  *************\n\nMy mom first noticed her ability to speak leaving in 2017, this \"illness\" has been a gradual climb since then and is now rapidly accelerating into her not being able to speak anymore. She can barely communicate for 2-3hrs of the day at the moment and this number is dwindling.\n\nShe has/is attempting western medicine solutions, we are on a long chain of specialists and referrals that started around late 2017.\n\nShe also believes in trying homeopathic/eastern medicine options, hence the long list of supplements.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns is the high level of Mycophenolic  Acid that appeared in my mothers urine samples. She was not tested for Mycophenolic acid until after she had been on her supplements for roughly six-eight months, she started the supplements early 2019.\n\nShe moved homes in 2018, the home she moved into was torn down to the foundation (by her) and rebuilt (this process **finished** in 2018), before moving in the home was checked for mold and no results came back. I have a theory that her furniture could have accumulated mold (all her main furniture sat in storage during the remodel).\n\nWhat I'm trying to do:\n\n\\- Make her condition and known results publicly and easily accessible by you guys\n\n\\- Forwarding all questions to her and recording all responses\n\n\\- Sending love to my mother\n\nWe plan on having the house re-checked for mold and will be moving her out temporarily in hopes that her condition improves (hoping that this is the cause of all this).\n\n**Please see edit 3 for the newest test results**\n\n# EDIT 2:\n\nThis is round one of information that I received, more will be incoming throughout the day when she finishes her swallow study today.\n\nAll symptoms are on the left side of throat/jaw/mouth\n\n**Tests:**\n\n* brain MRI in May 2019 was normal.\n* DAT scan for Parkinsons and PSP was normal in May 2019\n* EMG nerve test for ALS in April, 2019 was normal\n* Nuero psych exam in May 2020 normal\n* MRI of abdomen shows subcapsular cysts on spleen and thoracic roots\n* MRI of neck shows osteocytes on C 5,6\n* Abnormal blood tests are:\n* elevated ANA antibody\n* chronic past EBV infection-high titers\n* chronic low Vitamin D levels\n* Mycotoxin of Ochratoxin A and Mycophelonic acid\n* Heavy metals: Mercury, lead and arsenic.

In some of my childhood photos you can catch me scratching them by wedging my thumb nails under my ring nails.\n\n\nI've asked a dermatologist about it before during a consultation for a different issue (pityriasis rosea when I was 11) but they didn't hear me out much and said it's probably my rosea. I don't think it's fungal because my ring fingernails and ring toenails look just like the rest of my nails, except the nails start shorter (I cut them extra short and straight instead of curved).

While there have been reports of rare cases of blood clots and other adverse effects, the overall risk of serious complications from COVID-19 is much higher.

I have seen stats of people developing blood clots, dying, etc after getting vaccinated and I know it’s so very rare but again my fear and anxiety just won’t let me think logical about it. All I can think of is I will be apart of that tiny tiny percentage of people that dies from the vaccine. My biggest fear is me having some sort of medical issue that I don’t know about and the vaccine causing issues. \n\nPlease someone help ease my mind into getting vaccinated. I am so tired of leaving my house and being terrified of getting covid since I know I’m at greater risk being unvaxxed.

I'll list all my information and then get into my backstory/history with my medical issue. Also sorry about the wall of text I'm on mobile. \n\nAge: 24\nSex: Female\nHeight: 5'2''\nWeight: 140\nRace: Caucasian \nDuration: 12 years on and off\nLocation: North America, Midwest, vagina\nExisting medical issue: frequent yeast infections\nCurrent medications: fluconazole \nPhoto: none\n\nLike the title says, since I hit puberty I've gotten frequent yeast infections. When I was in my teens it was once every few months and I would treat with monastat 1. When monastat 1 stopped working I moved one to monastat 3. Then 5. Then 7. Then it stopped being effective all together. After monastat stopped working I would go the the gyno to have her prescribe me antibiotics. I can't remember what she would prescribe, but it worked and I wouldn't have a yeast infection for a few months until it came back. I started coming in so frequently for the problem with no long term solution, eventually my doctor yelled at me for coming back for the same problem so often, told me to tell my boyfriend to clean his penis better (had no boyfriend at the time) and gave me the roughest pap smear I've ever had. I never went back. \nI switched doctors when I was 20 to this lovely amazing women who was determined to find a long term solution for me. She gave so much information and I followed all of her advice. After 2 appointments with her, she prescribed me fluconazole to take on day one, then 3 days later. She also gave me 4 refills at a time so I wouldn't have to go to the doctor everytime I had a yeast infection since they were so frequent and I could tell when I was getting one easily. Unfortunately that doctor died in a plane crash before we could find a solution. \nI was given a new doctor (male) in the same practice who is nice, and took over the prescription refill for the fluconazole. He told me he wanted to try a preventative method and I took fluconazole once a week for 6 months. I noticed in the last 2 months of treatment I had a very minor yeast infection, not bad enough for me to be in major discomfort, but noticeable. \nThat's where I am now. The 6 month preventative treatment is done, I'm worried to make an appointment with my doctor because I'm afraid that he won't have an answer. I'm just tired of trying so many different things with no results. Over the span of 12 years I've tried changing soaps (for my vagina), using no soap, using baby wash (what I use currently) and using feminine wash. I've changed my diet (no added sugar, no bread). I wear only cotton underwear and sleep without underwear or bottoms. \nAt this point I'm just worried that I'm resistant to the antibiotics I'm taking, and since I have no kids and want to, I'm worried if this will affect it. And I know that yeast infections are more common in pregnant women, what if by the time get pregnant get an uncurable yeast infection? \n\nSO my question is, has anyone had any experience personally or with patients that this happened? Is there a new treatment I should talk to my doctor about or something I can try personally? Any advice would be appreciated. \nThanks for reading \n\nTLDR; frequent yeast infections for the last 12 years with no long term solution after trying multiple things.
