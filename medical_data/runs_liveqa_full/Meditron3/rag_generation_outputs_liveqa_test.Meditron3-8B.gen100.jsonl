There have, however, been continuing concerns about adverse effects. In the 1960s the risk of venous thromboembolism was linked to the dose of estrogen, which was consequently reduced. Later the risks of arterial disease were linked to progestogen dose, which was also reduced. In 1995, three case-control studies linked the risk of venous thromboembolism, not to dose, but to the type of progestogen. Newer 'third-generation' progestogens appeared to carry a higher risk than older formulations. Although the contraceptive pill was already known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism 3- to 6-fold, and the risks in the three studies were within this range, the public perception was that a new risk had been discovered. In the UK there were two consequences--a rapid change in prescribing patterns and a sharp increase in the abortion rate. Critics suggested that the studies may have been affected by confounding--e.g. by a 'new user' effect and differential prescribing. Views became very polarised. Between 1995 and 2001 second- and third-generation formulations were compared in 16 studies. Thirteen found that third-generation pills carried a higher risk of venous thromboembolism. Editorials and reviews recommended second-generation pills as the first choice for new users but official advice was that third-generation pills could still be prescribed, provided the risks were explained. Rates of thrombosis, per 100,000 women, are five for nonusers, 15 with second-generation pills and 25 for third-generation pills. The increase in mortality rates is around 1 to 2 per million. Drug-industry sponsored studies tended to find lower risks than independent studies and it was assumed that sponsorship produces bias, conscious or unconscious. It is also possible that some 'independent' researchers, motivated by antipathy to multinational pharmaceutical companies, are biased in the opposite way. Compared with the energy put into this debate, other aspects of pill prescribing remain under-researched. For example, doctors on opposite sides of the Atlantic are given different advice about whether gross obesity (a major risk factor for thromboembolism) is a contraindication to oral contraception. Women in developing countries continue to die of pregnancy-related causes and many deaths could be prevented by effective contraception.

All women 15-44 years old, suffering a first ever deep venous thrombosis or a first pulmonary embolism (PE) during the period January 1, 1994, to December 30, 1998, were included. Controls were selected annually, 600 per year in 1994-1995 and 1200 per year 1996-1998. Response rates for cases and controls were 87.2% and 89.7%, respectively. After exclusion of nonvalid diagnoses, pregnant women, and women with previous thrombotic disease, 987 cases and 4054 controls were available for analysis. A multivariate, matched analysis was performed. Controls were matched to cases within 1-year age bands. Adjustment was made for confounding influence (if any) from the following variables: age, year, body mass index, length of OC use, family history of VTE, cerebral thrombosis or myocardial infarction, coagulopathies, diabetes, years of schooling, and previous birth. The risk of VTE among current users of OCs was primarily influenced by duration of use, with significantly decreasing odds ratios (OR) over time: &lt;1 year, 7.0 (5.1-9.6); 1-5 years, 3.6 (2.7-4.8); and &gt;5 years, 3.1 (2.5-3.8), all compared with nonusers of OCs. After adjustment for confounders, current use of OCs with second- (levonorgestrel or norgestimate) and third- (desogestrel or gestodene) generation progestins when compared with nonuse resulted in ORs for VTE of 2.9 (2.2-3.8) and 4.0 (3.2-4.9), respectively. After adjusting for progestin types and length of use, the risk decreased significantly with decreasing estrogen dose. With 30-40 microg as reference, 20 and 50 microg products implied ORs of 0.6 (0.4-0.9) and 1.6 (0.9-2.8), respectively (p(trend) = 0.02). After correction for duration of use and differences in estrogen dose, the third/second-generation risk ratio was 1.3 (1.0-1.8; p &lt;0.05). In conclusion, use of OCs was associated significantly to the risk of VTE. The risk among current users was reduced by more than 50% during the first years of use. The risk increased more than 100% with increasing estrogen dose, and the difference in risk between users of third- and second-generation OCs, after correction for length of use and estrogen dose, was 33%.", "title": "Oral contraceptives and venous thromboembolism: a five-year national case-control study.", "score": 69.30912017822266, "source": "medrag"}, {"doc_id": "pubmed23n0299_13597", "text": "Four studies published since December, 1995, reported that the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was higher in women who used oral contraceptives (OCs) containing the third-generation progestagens gestodene or desogestrel than in users of OCs containing second-generation progestagens. However, confounding and bias in the design of these studies may have affected the findings. The aim of our study was to re-examine the association between risk of VTE and OC use with a different study design and analysis to avoid some of the bias and confounding of the earlier studies. We used computer records of patients from 143 general practices in the UK. The study was based on the medical records of about 540,000 women born between 1941 and 1981. All women who had a recorded diagnosis of deep-vein thrombosis, venous thrombosis not otherwise specified, or pulmonary embolus during the study period, and who had been treated with an anticoagulant were identified as potential cases of VTE. We did a cohort analysis to estimate and compare incidence of VTE in users of the main OC preparations, and a nested case-control study to calculate the odds ratios of VTE associated with use of different types of OC, after adjustment for potential confounding factors. In the case-control study, we matched cases to controls by exact year of birth, practice, and current use of OCs. We used a multiple logistic regression model that included body-mass index, number of cycles, change in type of OC prescribed within 3 months of the event, previous pregnancy, and concurrent disease. 85 women met the inclusion criteria for VTE, two of whom were users of progestagen-only OCs. Of the 83 cases of VTE associated with use of combined OCs, 43 were recorded as deep-vein thrombosis, 35 as pulmonary thrombosis, and five as venous thrombosis not otherwise specified. The crude rate of VTE per 10,000 woman-years was 4.10 in current users of any OC, 3.10 in users of second-generation OCs, and 4.96 in users of third-generation preparations. After adjustment for age, the rate ratio of VTE in users of third-generation relative to second-generation OCs was 1.68 (95% CI 1.04-2.75). Logistic regression showed no significant difference in the risk of VTE between users of third-generation and second-generation OCs. Among users of third-generation progestagens, the risk of VTE was higher in users of desogestrel with 20 g ethinyloestradiol than in users of gestodene or desogestrel with 30 g ethinyloestradiol. With all second-generation OCs as the reference, the odds ratios for VTE were 3.49 (1.21-10.12) for desogestrel plus 20 g ethinyloestradiol and 1.18 (0.66-2.17) for the other third-generation progestagens. The previously reported increase in odds ratio associated with third-generation OCs when compared with second-generation products is likely to have been the result of residual confounding by age. The increased odds ratio associated with products containing 20 micrograms ethinyloestradiol and desogestrel compared with the 30 micrograms product is biologically implausible, and is likely to be the result of preferential prescribing and, thus, confounding.", "title": "Population-based study of risk of venous thromboembolism associated with various oral contraceptives.", "score": 69.2884521484375, "source": "medrag"}], "retrieved_images": []}

It is demonstrated that development of production facilities and provision of health care with antibiotics was an extremely difficult task. Its solution was complicated by many factors such as the inaccessibility of advanced methods of deep fermentation, general technological backwardness, organizational problems associated with specificity of management and public decision-making. It is established that during 1944 the main producer of penicillin was the laboratory of VIEM and serial production of penicillin at the Karpov enterprise and plant of endocrine drugs in Moscow began only in late 1944, and amount production was were extremily not enough. In this situation, in early 1945, G. A. Miterev, the People's Commissar of Health Care, raised the question of buying plants for the production of penicillin in the United States. However, the final decision was not taken by the government. The attempt to devote part of the resources of the Central Military Sanitary Department of the Red Army for ensuring public health with antibiotic failed. In 1945, enterprises of the People's Commissariat of Meat and Dairy Industry were involved in the production of penicillin.

The therapy consists of bed rest, normalization of the urinary flow, a specific antibiotic therapy corresponding to the antibiotic sensitivity pattern and the administration of a prostaglandin-synthesis-inhibitor.

In severe acute infections, a calculated antibiotic therapy in certain combinations is necessary until the bacteriological findings are known.

In those tropical environments where hemolytic streptococcus is unusual in the throat flora, scarlet fever is unknown and rheumatic fever rare. In New York City, however, following epidemic waves of pharyngitis with hemolytic streptococcus the incidence of rheumatic fever rises precipitously. The correlation between the geographical distribution of hemolytic streptococcus and rheumatic fever is a definite one. Furthermore, in New York City during the seasons of the year in which hemolytic streptococcus is seldom recovered from the pharynx, acute attacks of rheumatism are unusual. Corresponding to the seasonal rise in hemolytic streptococcus infections, the curve of incidence of acute rheumatism shows a similar form. Among the children of wealthy patients, enjoying great protection, hemolytic streptococcus has been recovered infrequently from the throat, and rheumatism has not been encountered during this study. Among the poor under observation in New York City, however, the organism is found frequently in the pharyngeal flora, and rheumatic fever is common. The findings suggest that poverty and unhygienic living conditions favor both the activity of hemolytic streptococcus in the throat and the incidence of rheumatic fever. Moreover, localized outbreaks of rheumatism have been observed frequently following epidemics of \"sore throat\". Bacteriological studies of these upper respiratory infections demonstrate a close relationship between the advent of hemolytic streptococcus in the throat flora and the outbreak of rheumatic fever in susceptible individuals. In addition to these studies of streptococcus infections and their relationship to the development of rheumatic fever, observations of the rheumatic patient add further emphasis to this association. First, among a group of rheumatic children in an isolated environment, reactivation of the rheumatic process has been recognized only following the advent of hemolytic streptococcus in the throat flora. Also, an investigation of families in which several members have rheumatic heart disease has led to the same conclusion. Recrudescences of the disease have been observed under a variety of conditions among these individuals. However, the one constant factor in the outbreaks of recrudescences in rheumatic homes is their association with family epidemics of hemolytic streptococcus infection. Moreover, by studying rheumatic patients before, during and after transplantation to a tropical environment, it has been possible to demonstrate a close relationship between activity of the disease process and infection with hemolytic streptococcus. While the rheumatic patients remained in the tropics this organism was not recovered from the pharyngeal flora, and the disease process seemed quiescent. On return to New York City, those individuals who have escaped respiratory infection have remained symptom-free. However, of those who have contracted hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis, each has developed a rheumatic attack within 3 weeks after infection. Finally, extensive bacteriological studies made in ambulatory rheumatic subjects over a period of 4 years have demonstrated that the individuals who escape respiratory disease remain free of rheumatic manifestations.

With improved living conditions and access to antibiotics, the rates of GAS diseases in developed societies have gradually declined during the 20th century. However, genetic changes in circulating GAS strains and/or changes in host susceptibility to infection can lead to dramatic increases in the rates of specific diseases. No situations exemplify this more than the global upsurge of invasive GAS disease that originated in the 1980s and the regional increases in scarlet fever in north-east Asia and the UK. In each case, increased disease rates have been associated with the emergence of new GAS strains with increased disease-causing capability. Global surveillance for new GAS strains with increased virulence is important and determining why certain populations suddenly become susceptible to circulating strains remains a research priority.

Furthermore, repeated GAS infections may trigger autoimmune diseases, including acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever, and rheumatic heart disease. Combined, these diseases account for over half a million deaths per year globally. Genomic and molecular analyses have now characterized a large number of GAS virulence determinants, many of which exhibit overlap and redundancy in the processes of adhesion and colonization, innate immune resistance, and the capacity to facilitate tissue barrier degradation and spread within the human host. This improved understanding of the contribution of individual virulence determinants to the disease process has led to the formulation of models of GAS disease progression, which may lead to better treatment and intervention strategies. While GAS remains sensitive to all penicillins and cephalosporins, rising resistance to other antibiotics used in disease treatment is an increasing worldwide concern.

In addition to genetic factors, there are also major non-genetic contributions. It is here proposed that infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) was a major underlying cause of stuttering until the mid-1900s when penicillin was introduced in 1943. The main mechanism proposed is an autoimmune reaction from tonsillitis, targeting specific molecules, for example within the basal ganglia. It is here also proposed that GAS infections may have continued to cause stuttering to some extent, to the present date, though more rarely. If so, early diagnosis of such cases would be of importance. Childhood cases with sudden onset of stuttering after throat infection may be particularly important to assess for possible GAS infection. The support for this hypothesis primarily comes from three lines of argument. First, medical record data from the 1930s strongly indicates that there was one type of medical event in particular that preceded the onset of childhood stuttering with unexpected frequency: diseases related to GAS throat infections. In particular, this included tonsillitis and scarlet fever, but also rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is a childhood autoimmune sequela of GAS infection, which was a relatively widespread medical problem until the early 1960s. Second, available reports of changes of the childhood prevalence of stuttering indicate striking parallels between stuttering and the incidence of rheumatic fever, with: (1) decline from the early 1900s; (2) marked decline from the introduction of penicillin in the mid 1940s; and (3) reaching a more stable level in the 1960s. The correlations between the data for stuttering and rheumatic fever after the introduction of penicillin are very high, at about 0.95. Third, there are established biological mechanisms linking GAS tonsillitis to immunological effects on the brain. Also, a small number of more recent case reports have provided further support for the hypothesis linking stuttering to GAS infection. Overall, it is proposed that the available data provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that GAS infection was a major cause of stuttering until the mid-1900s, interacting with genetic predisposition.", "title": "Streptococcal Infection as a Major Historical Cause of Stuttering: Data, Mechanisms, and Current Importance.", "score": 67.07485961914062, "source": "medrag"}, {"doc_id": "pubmed23n1122_7184", "text": "Group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes superficial pharyngitis and skin infections as well as serious autoimmune sequelae such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and subsequent rheumatic heart disease.

However, even though our findings do not support the hypothesis that bone loss might continue to be accelerated several years after cessation of treatment we cannot fully address the question as to whether any residual benefit on bone mass over a longer period of time may be observed. In conclusion, the pattern of bone loss observed after cessation of estrogen therapy was found to be comparable to that which occurs in younger women within the first years after the menopause. Such a pattern needs to be kept in mind when the decision to stop HRT is taken, especially in women who were given HRT to prevent osteoporosis.

Symptoms attributed to wax (such as deafness and pain) are among the commonest reasons for patients to present to primary care with ear trouble.Wax is part of the ear's self-cleaning mechanism and is usually naturally expelled from the ear canal without causing problems. When this mechanism fails, wax is retained in the canal and may become impacted; interventions to encourage its removal may then be needed. Application of ear drops is one of these methods. Liquids used to remove and soften wax are of several kinds: oil-based compounds (e.g. olive or almond oil); water-based compounds (e.g. sodium bicarbonate or water itself); a combination of the above or non-water, non-oil-based solutions, such as carbamide peroxide (a hydrogen peroxide-urea compound) and glycerol.

We searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; Cochrane Register of Studies; PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 23 March 2018. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which a 'cerumenolytic' was compared with no treatment, water or saline, an alternative liquid treatment (oil or almond oil) or another 'cerumenolytic' in adults or children with obstructing or impacted ear wax. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were 1) the proportion of patients (or ears) with complete clearance of ear wax and 2) adverse effects (discomfort, irritation or pain). Secondary outcomes were: extent of wax clearance; proportion of people (or ears) with relief of symptoms due to wax; proportion of people (or ears) requiring further intervention to remove wax; success of mechanical removal of residual wax following treatment; any other adverse effects recorded and cost. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics. We included 10 studies, with 623 participants (900 ears). Interventions included: oil-based treatments (triethanolamine polypeptide, almond oil, benzocaine, chlorobutanol), water-based treatments (docusate sodium, carbamide peroxide, phenazone, choline salicylate, urea peroxide, potassium carbonate), other active comparators (e.g. saline or water alone) and no treatment.

Two studies applied drops for five days, but one study only applied the drops for 15 minutes.

Only two (141 participants;176 ears) provided useable data. There was no evidence of a significant difference in the number of adverse effects between the types of ear drops in these two studies. We summarised the remaining five studies narratively. All events were mild and reported in fewer than 30 participants across the seven studies (low-quality evidence).Secondary outcomesThree studies reported 'other' adverse effects (how many studies planned to report these is unclear).

Current practice for earwax removal generally involves the use of a softening agent, followed by irrigation of the ear if required. However, the safety and benefits of the different methods of removal are not known for certain. To conduct evidence synthesis of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the interventions currently available for softening and/or removing earwax and any adverse events (AEs) associated with the interventions. Eleven electronic resources were searched from inception to November 2008, including: The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (OVID), PREMEDLINE In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations (OVID), EMBASE (OVID); and CINAHL. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were applied to the full text or retrieved papers and data were extracted by two reviewers using data extraction forms developed a priori. Any differences were resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer. Study criteria included: interventions - all methods of earwax removal available and combinations of these methods; participants - adults/children presenting requiring earwax removal; outcomes - measures of hearing, adequacy of clearance of wax, quality of life, time to recurrence or further treatment, AEs and measures of cost-effectiveness; design - randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) for clinical effectiveness, cohort studies for AEs and cost-effectiveness, and costing studies for cost-effectiveness. For the economic evaluation, a deterministic decision tree model was developed to evaluate three options: (1) the use of softeners followed by irrigation in primary care; (2) softeners followed by self-irrigation; and (3) a 'no treatment' option. Outcomes were assessed in terms of benefits to patients and costs incurred, with costs presented by exploratory cost-utility analysis. Twenty-six clinical trials conducted in primary care (14 studies), secondary care (8 studies) or other care settings (4 studies), met the inclusion criteria for the review - 22 RCTs and 4 CCTs. The range of interventions included 16 different softeners, with or without irrigation, and in various different comparisons. Participants, outcomes, timing of intervention, follow-up and methodological quality varied between studies. On measures of wax clearance Cerumol, sodium bicarbonate, olive oil and water are all more effective than no treatment; triethanolamine polypeptide (TP) is better than olive oil; wet irrigation is better than dry irrigation; sodium bicarbonate drops followed by irrigation by nurse is more effective than sodium bicarbonate drops followed by self-irrigation; softening with TP and self-irrigation is more effective than self-irrigation only; and endoscopic de-waxing is better than microscopic de-waxing. AEs appeared to be minor and of limited extent. Resuts of the exploratory economic model found that softeners followed by self-irrigation were more likely to be cost-effective [24,433 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)] than softeners followed by irrigation at primary care (32,130 pounds per QALY) when compared with no treatment. Comparison of the two active treatments showed that the additional gain associated with softeners followed by irrigation at primary care over softeners followed by self-irrigation was at a cost of 340,000 pounds per QALY. When compared over a lifetime horizon to the 'no treatment' option, the ICERs for softeners followed by self-irrigation and of softeners followed by irrigation at primary care were 24,450 pounds per QALY and 32,136 pounds per QALY, respectively. The systematic review found limited good-quality evidence of the safety, benefits and costs of the different strategies, making it difficult to differentiate between the various methods for removing earwax and rendering the economic evaluation as speculative. Although softeners are effective, which specific softeners are most effective remains uncertain. Evidence on the effectiveness of methods of irrigation or mechanical removal was equivocal.

Reference lists of all trials were also manually searched. We identified all randomised controlled trials (with or without blinding) in which a cerumenolytic was evaluated in comparison with either no treatment, a placebo, or other cerumenolytics in participants with hard or impacted ear wax, and in which the proportion of participants with sufficient clearance of the external canal to make further mechanical clearance unnecessary (primary outcome measure) was stated or calculable. The full text articles of all the retrieved trials of possible relevance were reviewed by the two reviewers and the inclusion criteria applied independently. Any differences in opinion about which studies to include in the review were resolved by discussion. Trials were graded for methodological quality using the Cochrane approach. Data extraction was performed in a standardised manner by one reviewer and rechecked by the other reviewer, and where necessary investigators were contacted to obtain missing information. Meta-analysis was neither possible nor considered appropriate because of the heterogeneity of the treatments, treatment amounts and durations, trial procedures, and scoring systems. A narrative overview of the results is therefore presented. Eight trials satisfied the inclusion criteria, the majority of which were of poor quality.

One trial compared active treatments with no treatment, two trials compared active treatments with water or a saline 'placebo', and all eight trials placed two or more active treatments in head-to-head comparisons.

One trial found a significant difference between one of three active agents (Cerumol) in comparison to no treatment, but no statistically significant difference was found between these three agents (sodium bicarbonate ear drops; Cerumol; sterile water). In two trials no statistical difference was found between the effectiveness of either sodium bicarbonate ear drops, Cerumol, Cerumenex or Colace versus a sterile water or saline 'placebo'. Three trials (from the same source) found statistically significant differences in favour of the same active agent (Exterol) in comparison to glycerol and Cerumol. Three trials found no statistically significant difference between two or more cerumenolytics (Otocerol versus Cerumol; Audax versus Earex; sodium bicarbonate ear drops versus Cerumol). Two trials comparing the same two cerumenolytics (Cerumenex versus Colace) also failed to show any significant benefit of one over the other.

This approach is not justified in children less than 2 years of age and this for several reasons. First, AOM is an acute inflammation of the middle ear caused in about 70% of cases by bacteria. Redness and bulging of the tympanic membrane are characteristic findings in bacterial AOM. Second, AOM is associated with long-term dysfunction of the inflamed eustachian tube (ET), particularly in children less than 2 years of age. In this age group, the small calibre of the ET together with its horizontal direction result in impaired clearance, ventilation and protection of the middle ear. Third, recent prospective studies have shown poor long-term prognosis of AOM in children below 2 years with at least 50% of recurrences and persisting otitis media with effusion (OME) in about 35% 6 months after AOM. Viruses elicit AOM in about 30% of children. A prolonged course of AOM has been observed when bacterial and viral infections are combined because viral infection is also associated with ET dysfunction in young children. Bacterial and viral testing of the nasopharyngeal aspirate is an excellent tool both for initial treatment and recurrence of AOM. Antibiotic treatment of AOM is mandatory in children less than 2 years of age to decrease inflammation in the middle ear but also of the ET particularly during the first episode. The best choice is amoxicillin because of its superior penetration in the middle ear. Streptococci pneumoniae with intermediary bacterial resistance to penicillin are particularly associated with recurrent AOM. Therefore the dosage of amoxicillin should be 90 mg/kg per day in three doses. In recurrent AOM with beta-lactamase-producing bacilli, amoxicillin should be associated with clavulanic acid at a dose of 6.4 mg/kg per day. The duration of the treatment is not established yet but 10 days is reasonable for a first episode of AOM. OME may be a precursor initiating AOM but also a complication thereof. OME needs a watchful waiting approach. When associated with deafness for 2-3 months in children over 2 years of age, an antibiotic should be given according to the results of the bacterial resistance in the nasopharyngeal aspirate. The high rate of complications of tympanostomy tube insertion outweighs the beneficial effect on hearing loss. The poor results of this procedure are due to the absence of effects on ET dysfunction. Pneumococcal vaccination has little beneficial effects on recurrent AOM and its use in infants needs further studies. Treatment with amoxicillin is indicated in all children younger than 2 years with a first episode of AOM presenting with redness and bulging of the tympanic membrane. Combined amoxicillin and clavulanic acid should be given in patients with beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. The duration of treatment is estimated to be at least 10 days depending on the findings by pneumo-otoscopy and tympanometry. Bacterial and viral testing of the nasopharyngeal aspirate is highly recommended particularly in children in day care centres as well as for regular follow-up.

Three components--beta-blockers, diuretic and vasodilator--were systematically--alone and combined--applied. Of 188 patients 44% reacted on a beta-blocker alone, 22% on a diuretic alone, other 15% on the combination of the two as well as further 10% only on the triple combination with an addition of vasodilators. The beta-blocker-monotherapy was more successful in younger patients, frequently with high renin content, and in patients up to 60 years. In older patients, more frequently with low renin content, a diuretic or addition of vasodilators was necessary. The blood pressure before the treatment was, however, not decisive for the success of the therapy. In the remaining 9% the beta-blocker was either contraindicated, or even the triple combination did not decrease the diastolic pressure below the desirable aim of 95 Torr. A scheme of therapy, which is based on a beta-blocker, may besides be further simplified by long-acting substances allowing a single daily dosage. This fact is confirmed in a double comparison of Atenolol and Oxprenolol (slow release) in 13 patients.

Initially there was resistance to their use as the reduction of cardiac output and increase in peripheral resistance from beta-blockade was considered an undesirable pharmacological action for a drug in the treatment of hypertension. However, beta-blockers have now become established in the treatment of hypertension and have been recommended as a first line choice in various guidelines, although their exact mode of action remains a matter for debate. In broad terms beta-blocking drugs are at least of similar efficacy to the other major classes of antihypertensive drugs. They may be usefully combined with other anti-hypertensives, as is often required. There is some evidence that the beta-1 selective agents are more efficacious than the non-selective beta-blockers. Notwithstanding some observations to the contrary beta-blockers are often effective antihypertensive agents in the elderly and in black patients; the combination of being elderly and black, however, appears to result in a reduced fall in blood pressure. If they are given early in pregnancy they lead to a low birth weight. Co-existant disease may influence the choice of a beta-blocker to treat hypertension. Beta-blockers are valuable agents in ischaemic heart disease, notably the control of chronic angina pectoris and to improve prognosis post-myocardial infarction. While initial dose titration has to be extremely careful, heart failure is now a strong indication for the use of a beta-blocker, as prognosis is much improved. Diabetes should no longer be regarded as a contra-indication to the use of a beta-1 selective agent. Recent work confirms that beta-blockers should be given to patients undergoing surgery who have a high cardiac risk. Outcome studies suggest overall that in younger patients beta-blockers reduce the incidence of strokes and myocardial infarction. There is no convincing evidence of a difference between the ACE inhibitor captopril and the combination of diuretic and a beta-blocker. In high risk patients, i.e. those with diabetes, no difference was seen between captopril and atenolol. Diuretics may result in better outcome measurements in the elderly compared to beta-blockade but in combination, \"conventional treatment\" is as effective in terms of total mortality, strokes and myocardial infarction as ACE inhibitors or calcium antagonists. Co-existant asthma remains an important contraindication to beta-blockade, but not chronic obstructive airways disease where a beta-blocker should be used with caution if it is indicated, e.g. post-infarction. Quality of life measurements, at least with beta-1 selective agents compare favourably with other anti-hypertensive drugs. Beta-blockers, without partial agonist activity, should not be stopped abruptly, particularly in patients with, or at high risk of, co-existant ischaemic disease because of the danger of post-beta-blockade cardiac sympathetic hypersensitivity; alternatively bed rest should be instituted to reduce the risk of sympathetic stimulation.", "title": "Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs in the treatment of hypertension.", "score": 66.45437622070312, "source": "medrag"}, {"doc_id": "pubmed23n0631_22572", "text": "Hypertension is a health threat which, so far, is not successfully managed, despite the availability of effective drug treatment.

For example, propranolol and carvedilol are contraindicated in chronic obstructive lung disease, but nebivolol and bisoprolol are not. We suggest that contraindications which are specific for some BBs (i.e., not for the whole class) ought to be listed with the exact name(s) of the individual BBs. In this way, we may decrease the number of wrong choices among BBs and consequently increase drug adherence (which is currently worse for the class of BBs than for most of the other antihypertensive drugs).

Concomitant administration of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine with medications that enhance serotonin levels (e.g., antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and migraine medications) can precipitate serotonin syndrome. Sudden discontinuation of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine after prolonged administration can precipitate withdrawal depressive symptoms. Primary pulmonary hypertension, a potentially fatal disorder, has been reported to occur approximately 30 times more frequently in patients receiving anorectic agents for more than 3 months compared to the general population. More recently, the association of these popular anorectics with valvular heart disease has caused increased concerns about their use. The risks of primary pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, and the occurrence of convulsions, coma, and death in overdose appear to be equally likely with dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine.

Initially, I establish the diagnosis, exclude organic causes, educate patients about the disease, establish realistic expectations and consistent limits, and involve patients in disease management. I find it critical to determine why the patient is seeking assistance (eg, cancer phobia, disability, interpersonal distress, or exacerbation of symptoms). Most patients can be treated by their primary care physician. However, specialty consultations may be needed to reinforce management strategies, perform additional diagnostic tests, or institute specialized treatment. Psychological co-morbidities do not cause symptoms but do affect how patients respond to them and influence health care-seeking behavior. I find that these issues are best explored over a series of visits when the physician-patient relationship has been established. It can be helpful to have patients fill out a self-administered test to identify psychological co-morbidities. I often use these tests as a basis for extended inquiries into this area, resulting in the initiation of appropriate therapies. I encourage patients to keep a 2-week diary of food intake and gastrointestinal symptoms. In this way, patients become actively involved in management of their disease, and I may be able to obtain information from the diary that will be valuable in making treatment decisions. I do not believe that diagnostic studies for food intolerances are cost-effective or particularly helpful; however, exclusion diets may be beneficial. I introduce fiber supplements gradually and monitor them for tolerance and palatability. Synthetic fiber is often better-tolerated than natural fiber, but must be individualized. In my experience, excessive fiber supplementation often is counterproductive, as abdominal cramps and bloating may worsen. Antidiarrheal agents are very effective when used correctly, preferably in divided doses. I use them in patients in anticipation of diarrhea and especially in those who fear symptoms when engaged in activities outside the home. I encourage patients to make decisions as to when and how much to use. However, almost always, a morning dose before breakfast is used (loperamide, 2 to 6 mg) and, perhaps again later in the day when symptoms of diarrhea are prominent. I prefer antispasmodics to be used intermittently in response to periods of increased abdominal pain, cramps, and urgency. For patients with daily symptoms, especially after meals, agents such as dicyclomine before meals are useful. For patients with infrequent but severe episodes of unpredictable pain, sublingual hyoscyamine often produces rapid relief and instills confidence. In general, I recommend that oral antispasmodics be used for a limited period of time rather than indefinitely, and generally for periods of time when symptoms are prominent. For chronic visceral pain syndromes, I recommend small doses of tricyclic antidepressants. These agents are especially effective in diarrhea-predominant patients with disturbed sleep patterns but may be unacceptable to patients with constipation. I educate patients that side effects occur early and benefits may not be apparent for 3 to 4 weeks. I consider using SSRIs in low doses in patients with constipation-predominant IBS; cisapride, 10 to 20 mg three times per day, also may be beneficial. When taken with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450, cisapride has been associated with serious cardiac arrhythmias caused by QT prolongation, including ventricular arrhythmias and torsades de pointes. These drugs include the azole fungicides; erythromycin, clarithromycin, and troleandomycin; some antidepressants; HIV protease inhibitors; and others. In patients with IBS with mild to moderate co-morbid depression, I have found that the use of SSRIs such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, or sertraline may be beneficial. It is important to tell patients that anxiety and disturbed sleep may occur during the first 10 days and benefits may not occur for 3 to 4 weeks. I prescribe a small amount of a short-acting benzodiazepine such as alprazolam, 0.5 mg two times per day, to control these symptoms. For generalized anxiety without depression, buspirone or clonazepam may be useful. I have found that patients who also have associated panic disorder may benefit from a benzodiazepine, tricyclic antidepressant, or an SSRI. However, these patients are best managed in conjunction with a psychiatrist or psychologist. I consider the use of alternative therapies in patients who fail to respond to conventional measures and who are receptive to alternative strategies.

For symptom relief and to increase angina-free walking time, long acting nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and potassium channel openers can be used. Drugs from these 3 classes are all effective when used optimally and choice of initial therapy should consider the presence of concomitant disease and underlying left ventricular function.

Sometimes, however, it is lethal.  In countries such as the US, India and Brazil, where blood donors can get paid by the pint, drug addicts, street dwellers and others who have little to sell except their bodies flock to for-profit blood centers.  Many of these people carry the AIDS virus.  A survey in the Indian state of Maharashtra revealed that 27% of blood donors tested positive for AIDS antibodies--a slightly higher rate than the same survey found among prostitutes.  If 1 private blood bank tests for AIDS antibodies and turns HIV-positive volunteers away--forget about treating them--those poor and desperate enough can often find another, less scrupulous clinic.  Or a clinic that doesn't do the testing properly.  Although the 1988 Brazilian constitution banned the sale of blood, private clinics continue to flourish and nobody knows whose veins the blood is flowing from.  The inevitable result is a frightening rate of contamination.  An estimated 85% of Brazilian hemophiliacs have become infected with the HIV virus by contaminated blood or blood products.  Even in countries that eschew blood sales and rely on donated supplies, the danger of HIV contamination is still present.  HIV infection often does not generate antibodies for weeks; sometimes months or even years.  In many 3rd World communities without adequate equipment, blood storage is impossible.  The cost of testing emergency donations is so high that the choice may be narrowed--either go without testing or do without blood.  Despite all these obstacles, Zimbabwe has shown that a 3rd World country where public health care takes precedence over private profit can make the blood supply network a force for reducing the spread of AIDS rather than increasing it.  All blood donations in Zimbabwe were voluntary even before AIDS became an issue.  When AIDS was accorded recognition as a serious issue, the country had no clinic for HIV testing.  Concerned with the rapid spread of AIDS among the general population, the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) began testing in 1985.  Zimbabwe was the 3rd country in the world to begin routine testing.  The NBTS is a nonprofit organization headed by representatives from the ministry of health, the Red Cross, and private donors.  Because the NBTS was the only group in the country testing blood, many people who suspected they might be infected volunteered to donate blood just so they could have the test.  Unfortunately, their suspicions were often justified.  The service has found that regular donors now have a far lower incidence of HIV-positive since 1989, when alternative testing services were opened.  Analysts believe much of the credit goes to the AIDS counseling given before each blood donation.  Each individual is interviewed by a nurse who takes a comprehensive medical history.  The education session also includes how AIDS might be contracted.  The NBTS quickly discovered that the incidence of HIV antibodies was far lower among students aged 17-19.  Since then, the service has thrown much of its resources into school blood campaigns.  The service has also opened 5 new collection branches, 1 in each province.  Samples from each donation are sent to 1 of the 2 national centers for testing.

First, we investigated the context of scientific uncertainty and controversies prevailing between 1982 and 1985. Then we analysed the attitude and decisions of the French authorities in this situation to determine whether a principle of precaution was applied. Finally, we explored the reasons at the origin of the delay in controlling the risk.

In the prevailing climate of uncertainty, these measures could be seen as precautionary. However, the recommended measures were not widely applied. Cultural, structural and economic factors hindered their implementation. Our analysis provides insight into the use of precautionary principle in the domain of blood transfusion and, more generally, medicine. It also sheds light on the expectations that health professionals should have of this principle. The aim of the precautionary principle is to manage rather than to reduce scientific uncertainty. The principle is not a futile search for zero risk. Rather, it is a principle for action allowing precautionary measures to be taken.

My battle with AIDS, I'm certain, began in December 1982, at a bathhouse in Manhattan's East Village during a sexual encounter with a man whose name I didn't catch. Like other gay men, I had kept up with newspaper reports, beginning with a July 3, 1981, New York Times story with the fateful headline: \"Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals.\" Nevertheless, going to the baths was a big part of gay culture back then, and here I was. Old habits die hard. At the time, the federal Centers for Disease Control and medical authorities were saying little about this being an infectious disease. Indeed, they at first thought it probably wasn't. But it was pretty clear that GRID was caused either by the cumulative effects of too much sex (so many men, so many germs) or too much butyl nitrite (poppers), a sexual stimulant sniffed from little vials available for $5 at newsstands.

In the following years evidence accumulated from various studies that the thrombotic events in the antiphospholipid syndrome correlate with elevated serum titers of antiphospholipid antibodies. These autoantibodies represent a very heterogeneous group as multiple specificities against various negatively charged phospholipids are found. Most commonly described are antibodies against cardiolipin, but also cross-reactivities between the different phospholipids are observed. Moreover, efficient binding of antiphospholipid antibodies against a phospholipid requires the presence of certain protein-cofactors which on the other hand can be antigens themselves. Although numerous animal models strongly indicate that antiphospholipid antibodies play a causal role in the pathogenesis of the disease, the exact pathogenetic mechanisms are still to be elucidated. There is accumulating evidence from in vitro studies with poly- and monoclonal antiphospholipid antibodies that these autoantibodies are able to interfere with all aspects of the hemostatic balance. Influences of antiphospholipid antibodies on plasmatic processes of the coagulation cascade as well as antithrombotic and fibrinolytic mechanisms are described. Furthermore, antiphospholipid antibodies are able to exert prothrombotic effects on cells participating in hemostasis, mainly platelets and endothelial cells. Therapeutic approaches to the antiphospholipid syndrome today are mainly restricted to the prevention of further thrombosis by permanent anticoagulation.

Lack of standardization of the assays that define the serologic criteria, notably phospholipids-dependent coagulation assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for anticardiolipin and anti-beta2 glycoprotein I, have led to heated arguments regarding which population(s) of antibodies should be measured to detect a patient at risk for (recurrent) thrombosis or pregnancy complications.

Recently, LA has been considered to be closely related to phosphatidylserine anti-prothrombin antibody. APL is an independent risk factor for first-ever ischemic stroke and a prognostic marker of recurrent stroke. The precipitating factors for the occurrence of stroke are the presence of beta 2-GPI-dependent aCL, a GPL aCL level of more than 40, and the simultaneous presence of lupus anticoagulant. Several mechanisms are believed to be involved in the thrombotic process in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies. Human activated protein C functions as a potent anticoagulant in human plasma by inhibiting the activity of coagulation cofactors Va and VIIIa. Activation of protein C is impaired in patients with aPL. Recently, the presence of aPL has been considered to be contributory factor for the development of atherosclerotic lesions.

The authors studied the effect of morphine administered into the medullary dorsal horn (MDH), the brain stem homologue of the spinal dorsal horn, on facial-scratching behavior in monkeys. Morphine was unilaterally microinjected into the MDH of rhesus monkeys. Systemic injections of the opioid-receptor antagonist naloxone (0.5 mg/kg intramuscularly) were also made in combination with morphine microinjection. Systemic injections of the antihistamine chlorcyclizine (1.0 and 2.5 mg/kg intramuscularly) were also made to determine if facial scratching was mediated through histamine release. The monkeys were videotaped for 10-15 min before and 1-2 h after opioid microinjection, and the number and location of scratches were counted. A dose-response curve was established for the mu/delta-opioid-receptor agonist morphine (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 micrograms). Specificity of the site of action within the MDH was examined by systematically changing the microinjection site, and examining the area of the face that the monkeys scratched. Morphine produced large dose-dependent increases in facial scratching ipsilateral to the microinjection. Increases in facial scratching were also observed contralateral to the microinjections. These effects were reversed by naloxone. The facial area scratched after microinjection of morphine was directly related to the injection site, with 1-mm changes in the location of the microinjection resulting in pronounced changes in the area of the face that the monkeys scratched. Systemic injection of chlorcyclizine produced only a small, transient attenuation of morphine's effect. Data from this study demonstrate that the MDH is a site where morphine acts to produce facial scratching in monkeys by acting at opioid receptors.

In general, the actions of corticosteroids on carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism result in increased hepatic capacity for gluconeogenesis and enhanced catabolic actions upon muscle, skin, lymphoid, adipose and connective tissues. Because of the morbidity associated with steroid therapy, the clinician must carefully consider in each case the gains that can reasonably be expected from corticosteroid therapy versus the inevitable undesirable side effects of prolonged therapy. Thus, it is important to remember that the enhanced anti-inflammatory activity of the various synthetic analogues of cortisol is not dissociated from the expected catabolic actions of glucocorticoid hormones. Replacement therapy with physiological doses of cortisol in primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency is intended to simulate the normal daily secretion of cortisol. Short term, high dose suppressive glucocorticoid therapy is indicated in the treatment of medical emergencies such as necrotising vasculitis, status asthmaticus and anaphylactic shock. With improvement of the underlying disorder, the steroid dosage can be rapidly tapered and then discontinued over a 2 to 3 day period. Long term, high dose suppressive therapy is often commonly used to treat certain diseases (see sections 4.7.2 and 4.7.3). In this setting, suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may persist for as long as 9 to 12 months following steroid withdrawal if steroid doses are administered in the supraphysiological range for longer than 2 weeks. In general, higher doses, longer duration of usage, and frequent daily administration are all correlated with the severity of pituitary ACTH suppression. When steroid therapy is to be withdrawn, gradual tapering of the dosage is necessary; the steroid dosage should also be given as a single morning dose if possible. Rapid or total withdrawal of the steroid therapy may be associated with exacerbation of the underlying disease or with a steroid withdrawal syndrome. An additional important point to remember in any withdrawal programme is that the steroid dosage should be appropriately increased for an exacerbation of the underlying disease or for intercurrent major stress. Alternate day therapy is recommended as a steroid maintenance programme for patients requiring high dose glucocorticoid therapy over a prolonged period of time. Thus, it is usually employed to maintain a therapeutic benefit which had previously been extablished by daily steroid treatment. Complications resulting from corticosteroid therapy include: (1) proximal muscle weakness; (2) osteopenia; (3) unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus; (4) sodium retention and/or elevation of mean arterial blood pressure; (5) adverse psychiatric reactions; (6) development of glaucoma; and (7) reactivation of latent infections (such as tuberculosis).", "title": "Corticosteroids: clinical pharmacology and therapeutic use.", "score": 67.26471710205078, "source": "medrag"}, {"doc_id": "pubmed23n0360_17245", "text": "The action of glucocorticoids in high doses is catabolic, but not much is known about the accompanying effects on antioxidative capacity of the entire body.

It appears that chronic low-dose treatment with corticosteroids may contribute to irreversible loss of brain tissue in a variety of autoimmune diseases. This side effect of steroid therapy is probably mediated by steroid-induced protein catabolism mechanism. Evidence is mounting that high-dose corticosteroids may induce reversible short-term brain volume changes due to loss of intracellular water and reduction of abnormal vascular permeability, without there having been axonal loss. Other apoptotic and selective inhibiting mechanisms have been proposed to explain the nature of corticosteroid-induced brain volume fluctuations. It has been shown that chronic use of high dose intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) in patients with MS may limit brain atrophy progression over the long-term via different immunological mechanisms, including downregulation of adhesion molecule expression on endothelial cells, decreased cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase secretion, decreased autoreactive T-cell-mediated inflammation and T-cell apoptosis induction, blood-brain barrier closure, demyelination inhibition and, possibly, remyelination promotion. Studies in nonhuman primates have confirmed that short-term brain volume fluctuations may be induced by corticosteroid treatment, but that they are inconsistent, potentially reversible and probably dependent upon individual susceptibility to the effects of corticosteroids.

They are secreted together with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in response to the pulsatile secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Changes in pulse amplitude are responsible for the diurnal rhythm in circulating ACTH and cortisol levels. Steroid levels increase immediately after injury, pain, fever, and hypovolemia in response to the stimulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion by various cytokines. The increase in steroid levels is typically proportional to the magnitude of stress, with serum cortisol values being highest in moribund patients and shortly before death. With severe and prolonged stress, steroid levels are increased for weeks to months and may be associated with hypertrophy of the adrenal cortex. Cortisol acts in concert with catecholamines to maintain the vascular tone, endothelial integrity, vascular permeability, and the distribution of total body water within the vascular compartment. It also potentiates the vasoconstrictor effects of catecholamines. Cortisol helps to stimulate lipolysis, inhibit protein synthesis, facilitate amino acid mobilization from muscle, induce the enzymes of gluconeogenesis, enhance secretion of glucagon, inhibit insulin secretion, and stimulate conversion of lactic acid to glycogen.

However, reliance on the symptomatic clinical course to assess disease activity may be misleading. As many patients being treated with corticosteroids have an abrupt clinical deterioration when doses of those medications are decreased, we questioned whether the chest radiograph could depict alterations in disease activity as measured by spirometry in this subset of patients. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of all patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis in whom the corticosteroid dose was reduced during a 6-month period. The 15 patients without fever, chills, or purulent sputum during that time were then examined to determine the presence (n = 10) or absence (n = 5) of a symptomatic relapse. All patients who had a symptomatic relapse also had a fall in forced vital capacity of at least 10%, suggesting an increase in disease activity. Serial chest radiographs were evaluated during and after corticosteroid dose reductions and after clinical recovery on higher steroid doses in the patients who had had a relapse. In eight patients, the disease was in radiographic stage 2 (hilar adenopathy and parenchymal lung disease); in seven patients it was in radiographic stage 3 (parenchymal lung disease alone). The disease did not change stage in any patient during the study. Chest radiographs worsened more frequently in patients who had a clinical relapse (seven of 10) than in those who did not have a relapse (zero of five, p less than .05).

Spirometry and radiographs improved or stabilized after an increase in corticosteroid dose in all 10 patients who had a relapse.

Existing modalities for treating dysphagia are generally ineffective, and at best it may take weeks to months to show improvement. One common conventional therapy, application of cold stimulus to the base of the anterior faucial arch, has been reported to be somewhat effective.

Compare the effectiveness of ES treatment to thermal-tactile stimulation (TS) treatment in patients with dysphagia caused by stroke and assess the safety of the technique. In this controlled study, stroke patients with swallowing disorder were alternately assigned to one of the two treatment groups (TS or ES). Entry criteria included a primary diagnosis of stroke and confirmation of swallowing disorder by modified barium swallow (MBS). TS consisted of touching the base of the anterior faucial arch with a metal probe chilled by immersion in ice. ES was administered with a modified hand-held battery-powered electrical stimulator connected to a pair of electrodes positioned on the neck. Daily treatments of TS or ES lasted 1 hour.

Occurrence of REM sleep and the NREM-REM sleep cycle are probably determined by a balance or interaction between the cholinergic and cholinoceptive REM sleep-on neuronal populations and the monoaminergic REM sleep-off neuronal population. Neural activities producing generalized muscle atonia in REM sleep originate mainly in dorsolateral portions of the pontine reticular formation, descend through the medulla and spinal cord, and inhibit the motoneurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, bringing about postural atonia. Cataplexy and sleep paralysis are pathological, dissociated manifestations of the generalized muscle atonia characteristic REM sleep. Cataplexy is triggered by emotional stimuli, probably through activation of the neural structure generating the muscle atonia of REM sleep. During long-lasting cataplectic attacks, narcoleptic humans often experience sleep paralysis and vivid hypnagogic hallucinations in the latter sleep state. Sleep paralysis is caused by the marked dissociation between level of alertness and muscle atonia that often occurs in SOREM sleep episodes. Frequent SOREM sleep episodes in narcoleptic humans and dogs may occur when some of the neural mechanisms producing wakefulness and/or NREM sleep that normally inhibit the occurrence of REM sleep are abnormally weak, or when neural mechanisms facilitating the occurrence of REM sleep are hypersensitive or hyperactive, or both. Both abnormalities may contribute to the occurrence of SOREM sleep episodes and sleep paralysis, and also to the emotional triggering of cataplexy. Frequent occurrence of SOREM sleep episodes seems to be prerequisite but not sufficient for the occurrence of cataplexy. Some additional neural activities induced by emotion also contribute by inhibiting and/or activating the disturbed neural mechanisms related to SOREM sleep episodes. These abnormalities in neural mechanisms probably involve hypersensitivity or hyperactivity of muscarinic cholinergic and/or cholinoceptive neuronal populations in the pontine and suprapontine structures, and/or abnormally decreased activity of noradrenergic or serotonergic neuronal populations in the pons and/or other brainstem structures. This last monoaminergic neuronal population probably has a gating or inhibiting effect upon the cholinergic and cholinoceptive neuronal populations related to the generation of generalized muscle atonia and REM sleep.

Other causes of symptoms while exercising include being out of shape, poorly controlled nasal allergies or vocal cord issues.\n\t\t\t\t\tEven the sport you choose can affect your symptoms.

We examined prospectively the in-hospital clinical course of 39 consecutive patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction in whom the age of a right bundle branch block upon admission was unknown (group C, n = 39) and compared with two similar groups of patients who presented with an acute right bundle branch block (group A, n = 38) and with a known chronic right bundle branch block (group B, n = 22). Thirty-three patients (33%) died, with cardiogenic shock being the leading cause of death in the entire population. Prophylactic pacing, which was carried out in 66% and 54% of patients in groups A and C, respectively, did not reduce mortality rates. No clinical or electrocardiographic variables on admission were predictive to support prophylactic pacing in group C. In 10 of 46 (22%) patients who were prophylactically paced with a transvenous electrode, the following complications attributed to the procedure were detected: (1) either rapid sustained ventricular tachycardia (during implantation) that was unresponsive to overdrive pacing, or ventricular fibrillation necessitating electrical defibrillation (4 patients); (2) recurrent episodes of rapid nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, which stopped only after the pacemaker was turned off (1 patient); (3) complete AV block (1 patient); (4) fever appearing on the third or fourth day after implantation (3 patients); and (4) a large hematoma in the groin in 1 patient who was treated with thrombolysis shortly before pacemaker electrode insertion. Thus, the complications of transvenous temporary pacing in the era of thrombolysis may outweight any theoretical advantage.", "title": "Right bundle branch block of unknown age in the setting of acute anterior myocardial infarction: an attempt to define who should be paced prophylactically.", "score": 69.51329040527344, "source": "medrag"}, {"doc_id": "pubmed23n0874_8559", "text": "The diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) in the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB) or during ventricular pacing (VP) is challenging because of inherent changes in the sequence of ventricular depolarization and repolarization associated with both conditions. Although LBBB and right ventricular (RV) pacing may both produce abnormalities in the ECG, it is often possible to diagnose an acute MI (AMI) or an old MI based on selected morphologic changes. Primary ST-segment changes scoring 3 points or greater according to the Sgarbossa criteria are highly predictive of an AMI in patients with LBBB or RV pacing. The modified Sgarbossa criteria are useful for the diagnosis of AMI in patients with LBBB; however, these criteria have not yet been studied in the setting of RV pacing. Although changes of the QRS complex are not particularly sensitive for the diagnosis of an old MI in the setting of LBBB or RV pacing, the qR complex and Cabrera sign are highly specific for the presence of an old infarct. Diagnosing AMI in the setting of biventricular (BiV) pacing is challenging. To date there is minimal evidence suggesting that the traditional electrocardiographic criteria for diagnosis of AMI in bundle branch block may be applicable to patients with BiV pacing and positive QRS complexes on their ECG in lead V1.

The electrocardiographic criteria of the recognition of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients with a ventricular pacing are similar to the electrocardiographic criteria of the recognition of AMI in patients with LBBB. They are applicable in the first phase of AMI's diagnostic process and they are known as Sgarbossa's criteria. However, one should remember about differences between these two groups of patients and therefore particular criteria have got different significance in patients from each group. There are three Sgarbossa's criteria: ST-segment elevation of &gt;/= 5 mm in the presence of a negative QRS complex, ST-segment elevation of &gt;/= 1 mm in the presence of a positive QRS complex and ST-segment depression of &gt;/= 1 mm in lead V1, V2 or V3.

Procedure times (139.1 ± 49.1 vs 135.3 ± 45.6 minutes, P = .248) and major complications (1.66% vs 2.87%, P = .216) were similar. Women had different clinical characteristics than men, similar initial and repeat ablation success rates but lower overall success because of fewer repeat ablations (57.8% vs 68.2%, P = .047) due to patient choice (P = .028). Patients with either successful initial ablations or undergoing repeat ablations had late AF recurrence rates of 0% to 1.5% a year. Age (P = .012), larger left atria (P = .002), female sex (P = .001), AF2 (P &lt; .0001), AF3 (P = .003), and coronary disease (P = .003) predicted failure. Repeat ablations are more successful than initial ablations, have similar procedure times and complication rates, help determine final success rates, and may explain sex difference in success rates.

One of the methods currently being evaluated uses radio-frequency energy which has certain advantages compared with direct current ablation because of the progressive and limited lesions it produces. This technique was used in 24 patients with atrial arrhythmias resistant to antiarrhythmic therapy. The radio-frequency energy was delivered without general anaesthesia with HAT 100 and 200 (OSYPKA) generators in the unipolar mode (average 17.4 watts) for an average period of 22.3 +/- 8 seconds. The catheter (8F USCI suction catheter in the first 18 patients and a 7F Polaris Mansfield, deflectable catheter with a large distal electrode in the remainder) was positioned at the nodo-hisian junction at a point where the two distal electrodes recorded a large atrial deflection and the smallest possible hisian potential. The conduction defects induced during the acute phase generally remain stable in cases of complete atrioventricular block and tend to regress in cases of incomplete atrioventricular block despite initial control of atrioventricular conduction. During follow-up (21 +/- 16 months), 14 patients (58%) remained in complete atrioventricular block, 4 patients (17%) had controlled atrioventricular conduction with an acceptable ventricular rate with associated previously ineffective antiarrhythmic therapy. Radio-frequency ablation was a failure in 6 patients (25%). There were no haemodynamic, rhythmic or ischaemic complications during the acute phase or during follow-up. These results suggest radio-frequency energy is a seductive alternative to direct current ablation for percutaneous modification of atrioventricular conduction in patients with refractory atrial arrhythmias. However, simple modulation of atrioventricular conduction gives aleatory results due to the tendency to regression during follow-up. On the other hand, complete atrioventricular blocks created by radio-frequency energy are generally definitive and are associated with a junctional escape rhythm which is usually stable.", "title": "[Percutaneous ablation of atrioventricular junction by radiofrequency current in resistant atrial arrhythmia.

Electrophysiologic evaluation of atrial flutter included activation mapping with a 20 electrode halo catheter placed around the tricuspid annulus and entrainment mapping from within the low right atrial isthmus. After confirmation of the arrhythmia mechanism with these techniques, an anatomic approach was used to create a linear lesion between the inferior tricuspid annulus and the eustachian ridge at the anterior margin of the inferior vena cava. In order to demonstrate successful ablation, mapping techniques were employed to show that bi-directional conduction block was present in the low right atrial isthmus. Successful ablation was achieved in 26/27 patients (96%). In one patient with a grossly enlarged right atrium, isthmus block could not be achieved. Of the 26 patients with successful ablation, there has been one recurrence of typical flutter (4%) during a mean follow-up period of 5.5 +/- 2.7 months.

However, they differ in several respects like selectivity for cyclic nucleotides, sensitivity for inhibitors and activators, physiological roles and tissue distribution. Interest in these enzymes has increased tremendously, both within the medical community and in the general public as a consequence of sildenafil (Viagra), the medication recently introduced for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil mediates its effects by inhibiting phosphodiesterase 5. Some biochemical and molecular biological aspects of this enzyme are presented here. To achieve satisfactory erection, normal penile innervation is required. Nitrogen monoxide, the transmitter substance in these nerves, activates guanylyl cyclase, thereby increasing cyclic GMP production. The increased levels of cyclic GMP cause relaxation of smooth muscles in penile vessels and this leads to an erection. Erection is dependent on elevated levels of cyclic GMP and sildenafil mediates its effects by inhibiting the degradation of cyclic GMP.

Attention to this topic has been spurred by the advent of (highly profitable) sexuopharmaceutical 'solutions' to erectile changes affecting older men. 'Success' stories abound in the media and in medical literature related to the restoration of faulty erections and ailing sex lives through drugs such as Viagra (sildenafil citrate), Uprima (apomorphine) and Cialis (tadalafil). In this paper we explore some of the ways in which notions about ageing and male sexuality are changing in popular cultural and medical texts in response to the advent of Viagra and the increasing authority of biomedicine in this area. We also demonstrate how the recent biomedical endorsement of 'sex for life' (the imperative to maintain an active youthful masculine [hetero]sexuality - defined in terms of male orgasm through penetrative sex) may be challenged by the very accounts of older men who are, or have been, affected by erectile difficulties and have used drugs like Viagra themselves. We present the perspectives of mid-to-late life heterosexual men in New Zealand whose stories question the contemporary biomedical privileging of erections and intercourse 'at any cost and at any age'. We argue that the current push to identify and treat so-called erectile dysfunction (and restore erections and penetrative sex to relationships) neglects some men's own experiences of alternative modes of relating sexually that they identify as 'normal', 'healthy', 'enjoyable' and 'satisfying' for them and their partners; and undermines their understanding of such changes as positive outcomes of ageing, experience and maturity.", "title": "'Sex for life'?

Following the discovery of popular--and profitabl-e-sexuopharmaceuticals such as sildenafil citrate (Viagra) for the treatment of erectile difficulties affecting men, the medical model has gained increasing influence in the domain of sexual health and well-being. However, while medical definitions of--and interventions related to--sexual difficulties are underpinned by an understanding of a 'universal' body (that is, an essential biological body that transcends culture and history), and by the categorisation of the normal and the pathological, the accounts of users of Viagra, and their sexual partners, do not necessarily support such understandings. In some cases, the experiences and perspectives of those affected by erectile difficulties directly challenge the reductionist model of sexuality and sexual experience espoused by medicine. In this paper, we report on a New Zealand study investigating the socio-cultural implications of Viagra, involving 33 men and 27 women discussing the impact of erectile difficulties and Viagra use within relationships. The diverse experiences of participants are discussed in relation to two key issues: the notion of 'sexual dysfunction' itself; and the idea of drugs such as Viagra acting as a 'quick fix' for sexual difficulties affecting men.

HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated\n\t\t\t\t\tblood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use.

A 65-year-old male farmer presented with multiple, asymptomatic vesicles over the scrotum with thickened scrotal and penile skin that had occurred for six years. He gave past history of intermittent fever and milky urine, was diagnosed with filariasis and treated with diethylcarbamazine for a year, four years previously.

A few radially arranged linear irregular vessels were noted over the nodules. On histopathology, multiple ectatic lymphatics were noted in the mid and upper dermis with acanthosis and superficial perivascular lymphocytes. Peripheral smear revealed eosinophils; however, microfilariae could not be detected despite repeated diethylcarbamazine provocation and night smears being taken.

Of resected appendices, every fifth to sixth is histologically normal. It has been suggested that local skin temperature could be helpful to diagnose appendicitis. The hypothesis was that skin temperature above an inflamed appendix was higher than elsewhere. Patients suspected of acute appendicitis admitted to Landspitalinn University Hospital, February through June 1993, were enrolled. Thirty six patients, 20 males and 16 females, aged 12 to 77, average 29, entered the study. Skin temperature was measured over McBurney's point and at a comparable spot on the left side of the abdomen. Beside the skin temperature there were also noted some symptoms from the history and examination and some lab results. For each of these variables sensitivity, specificity and prospective values for appendicitis, were calculated. Of those 36 patients, 27 underwent surgery, 22 had appendicitis but 14 did not. Six of the patients had 5=0.5 degrees C higher temperature at McBurney's point but only two of them had appendicitis. The other 30 patients did not have that temperature difference but still 16 of them had appendicitis. The predictive value of a positive and a negative test was 33% each, for skin temperature measurements, sensitivity was 9% and specificity 71%.

In addition, an estimated 36 million Americans use over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics daily. Given this volume of use, it is not surprising that a number of drug interactions involving analgesic drugs have been reported. This article examines the pharmacologic factors that enhance the clinical relevance of potential drug interactions and reviews the literature on drug interactions involving the most commonly used analgesic preparations in the United States. A PubMed search was conducted for English-language articles published between January 1967 and July 2007. Among the search terms were drug interactions, acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib, NSAIDs, hydrocodone, oxycodone, codeine, tramadol, OTC analgesics, alcohol, ethanol, antihypertensive drugs, methotrexate, warfarin, SSRIs, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, serotonin syndrome, MAOIs, and overdose. Controlled clinical trials, case-control studies, and case reports were included in the review. A number of case reports and well-controlled clinical trials were identified that provided evidence of the relatively well known drug-drug interactions between prescription/OTC NSAIDs and alcohol, antihypertensive drugs, high-dose methotrexate, and lithium, as well as between frequently prescribed narcotics and other central nervous system depressants. In contrast, the ability of recent alcohol ingestion to exacerbate the hepatotoxic potential of therapeutic doses of acetaminophen is not supported by either case reports or clinical research. Use of ibuprofen according to OTC guidelines in patients taking cardioprotective doses of aspirin does not appear to interfere with aspirin's antiplatelet activity, whereas chronic prescription use of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs may interfere. Low-dose aspirin intake appears to abolish the gastroprotective effects of cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors, including celecoxib. There is evidence of other less well known and potentially clinically significant drug-drug interactions, including the ability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors to inhibit the analgesic activity of tramadol and codeine through inhibition of their metabolic activation, to induce serotonin syndrome when used chronically in the presence of high doses of tramadol through synergistic serotonergic action, and to increase the potential for gastrointestinal bleeding associated with NSAID therapy through additive or supra-additive antiplatelet activity. Considering the widespread use of analgesic agents, the overall incidence of serious drug-drug interactions involving these agents has been relatively low.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any intervention (drug, electrolyte, vitamin or non-drug therapies) for treatment of leg cramps in pregnancy compared with placebo, no treatment or other treatment. Quinine was excluded for its known adverse effects (teratogenicity). Cluster-RCTS were considered for inclusion. Quasi-RCTs and cross-over studies were excluded. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We included six studies (390 women). Four trials compared oral magnesium with placebo/no treatment, two compared oral calcium with no treatment, one compared oral vitamin B versus no treatment, and one compared oral calcium with oral vitamin C. Two of the trials were well-conducted and reported, the other four had design limitations. The process of random allocation was sub-optimal in three studies, and blinding was not attempted in two. Outcomes were reported in different ways, precluding the use of meta-analysis and limiting the strength of our conclusions.The 'no treatment' group in one four-arm trial has been used as the comparison group for the composite outcome (intensity and frequency of leg cramps) in magnesium, calcium, and vitamin B versus no treatment. This gives it disproportionate weight in the overall analysis, thus interpretation of these results should be cautious. Oral magnesium versus placebo/no treatmentMagnesium (taken orally for two to four weeks) did not consistently reduce the frequency of leg cramps compared with placebo or no treatment. Outcomes that showed differences were: frequency of leg cramps after treatment: never, and twice a week (risk ratio (RR) 5.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35 to 23.68, one trial, 69 women, evidence graded low; RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.80, one trial, 69 women), and frequency of leg cramps: 50% reduction in number of leg cramps after treatment (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.86, one trial, 86 women, evidence graded low). The outcomes that showed no difference were: frequency of leg cramps during two weeks of treatment (mean difference (MD) 1.80, 95% CI -1.32 to 4.92, one trial, 38 women, evidence graded low); frequency of leg cramps after treatment: daily, every other day, and once a week (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.21, one trial, 69 women; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.57, one trial, 69 women; RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.87, one trial, 69 women).Evidence about whether magnesium supplements reduced the intensity of pain was inconclusive, with two studies showing that it may slightly reduce pain, while one showed no difference. There were no differences in the experience of side effects (including nausea, flatulence, diarrhoea and intestinal air) between pregnant women receiving magnesium compared with placebo/no treatment. Oral calcium versus no treatmentA greater proportion of women receiving calcium supplements experienced no leg cramps after treatment than those receiving no treatment (frequency of leg cramps after treatment: never RR 8.59, 95% CI 1.19 to 62.07, one study, 43 women, evidence graded very low). There was no difference between groups for a composite outcome (intensity and frequency) for partial improvement (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.15, one trial, 42 women); however, the same trial showed a greater proportion of women experiencing no leg cramps after treatment with calcium compared with no treatment (RR 5.50, 95% CI 1.38 to 21.86).Other secondary outcomes, including side effects, were not reported. Oral vitamin B versus no treatment Frequency of leg cramps was not reported in the one included trial. According to a composite outcome (frequency and intensity), more women receiving vitamin B fully recovered compared with those receiving no treatment (RR 7.50, 95% CI 1.95 to 28.81). Those women receiving no treatment were more likely to experience a partial improvement in the intensity and frequency of leg cramps than those taking vitamin B (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73, one trial, 42 women), or to see no change in their condition. However, these results are based on one small study with design limitations.Other secondary outcomes, including side effects, were not reported.

Other outcomes, includingside effects, were not reported. It is unclear from the evidence reviewed whether any of the interventions (oral magnesium, oral calcium, oral vitamin B or oral vitamin C) provide an effective treatment for leg cramps. This is primarily due to outcomes being measured and reported in different, incomparable ways, and design limitations compromising the quality of the evidence (the level of evidence was graded low or very low). This was mainly due to poor study design and trials being too small to address the question satisfactorily.Adverse outcomes were not reported, other than side effects for magnesium versus placebo/no treatment. It is therefore not possible to assess the safety of these interventions.The inconsistency in the measurement and reporting of outcomes, meant that data could not be pooled, meta-analyses could not be carried out, and comparisons between studies are difficult.The review only identified trials of oral interventions (magnesium, calcium, vitamin B or vitamin C) to treat leg cramps in pregnancy.

Women appeared conscious of representing their drinking as rational, measured and safe, particularly when discussing weekday use, and drinking alone. Women described it as an act of relaxation, and rationalised it as earned. Alcohol consumption on weekends was strongly tied to social connection. Alcohol was explicitly described as the means to see people socially and was also implicitly present in social gatherings such as lunches, barbecues and dinners on weekends. Although women rejected the notion of experiencing social pressures to consume alcohol, they also described needing excuses for not consuming alcohol, such as partaking in temporary abstinence periods such as Dry July.

Living in crowded, poorly-ventilated quarters facilitates transmission. Not many virus particles survive in saliva and it is difficult to infect via the lips or mouth. Kissing does not efficiently spread cold infection. Prophylactic treatment with interferon does not protect against cold infection. Aspirin and acetaminophen reduced serum antibody response and increased nasal symptoms in a controlled Australian study. The combination of intranasal interferon and ipratropium with oral naproxen gave promising results in experimental rhinovirus inoculation.

With the unheated but not with the heated secretions from four of six such patients we have succeeded in transmitting an affection indistinguishable from common cold to four men and in two instances the condition was conveyed from the person with the experimental disease to a second individual -in all, therefore, to six supposedly normal subjects. The periods of incubation in the experimental disease varied from 8 to 48 hours. We failed to obtain these results with the filtered secretions from cases of common colds 18 and 20 hours after the onset of symptoms and from a patient with the experimental disease 20 hours after the first symptoms. It would appear that the secretions are more active in the early hours of the affection. We also failed in the two instances in which colds were caused by exposure to the elements, or chilling of the body, and not by definite contact with other cases of common colds. Intratracheal inoculations in rabbits with unfiltered and filtered nasopharyngeal washings obtained from patients with common colds induce no characteristic or distinctive effects on the tissues, from which no constant, pathogenic agent has, as yet, been recovered. In comparison, similar material from cases of epidemic influenza do, however, cause particular changes in the blood and lungs of these animals, cultures of the lungs often yielding Bacterium pneumosintes. In view of these facts and since the clinical pictures exhibited by these diseases differ, the conclusion may be drawn that infectious common colds and epidemic influenza are separate and distinct diseases. On the other hand, the negative results obtained with materials derived from common colds and from parallel series of experiments with secretions from supposedly healthy persons, serve as a control to the effects produced with the nasopharyngeal washings obtained from influenza patients. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures of the filtered nasopharyngeal washings from 40 early cases of infectious common colds have thus far yielded no constant, pathogenic agent which can be regarded as the incitant of the disease. The filtered washings of nineteen cases were studied by the combined method of Smith-Noguchi fluid medium and anaerobic blood agar plates. In these instances representatives of the three groups of anaerobic filter-passing, Gram-negative bacteria, described by Olitsky and Gates were cultured from twelve patients. The irregularity of their occurrence not only in common colds but in influenza and supposedly normal persons and their lack of pathogenicity for rabbits and man indicate that these bacteria are not peculiar to common colds. This method has opened to view a number of hitherto undescribed microorganisms which can be found in different respiratory affections and in health. Furthermore, by morphological, cultural, and serological means, the separation into distinct species of each of these groups of bacteria has again been demonstrated. It is noteworthy that Bacterium pneumosintes was not found in any of the cultures from the 40 patients. Special attention was given to the detection of elements similar to Foster's globoid bodies in the cultures derived from common colds and from the experimental disease in man, and from the lungs of inoculated rabbits. We have not been able to determine the presence of these bodies, although the precipitate which forms in fresh rabbit kidney tissue-ascitic fluid medium was illusory in such relation since it was a common experience to find this precipitate simulating the globoid bodies of poliomyelitis. Still more disturbing is the fact, that these particles could be carried over from subplant to subplant and even showed pseudo colony formation in the Noguchi semisolid medium in tubes. But when the particles were put to rigorous test for a living and multiplying organism, the tests failed to reveal multiplication. The increasing importance of the tissue-ascitic fluid medium in bacteriological technique warrants a detailed description of the requirements necessary for the determination of the living nature of formed elements in cultures in this medium, (a) No one method of staining can be relied upon, for stain precipitate in itself adds to the confusion. A specimen for examination should be stained separately by Gram's and Giemsa's methods and with another nudear dye, such as polychrome methylene blue. As a rule, microorganisms will reveal their morphological characters in more than one stain, whereas precipitate may be found in only one and not in the others. The experienced eye will discern the precipitated particles in selected parts of the stained preparation where they often occur in enormous numbers, clumped into irregular masses of varying forms from the periphery of which there is a gradual fading out to finer, more uniform structures. (b) In addition, suspected growths should be tested in the dialysate medium of Gates since by this method the precipitated material of the medium is kept from admixing with the growth, and a clear view of any microorganisms, if present, is obtained, (c) Another requirement is colony formation of the suspected culture. This is an absolute essential and can be effected by planting the material to be tested on solid plate media, incubated aerobically, and anaerobically in Brown's jar. Semisolid medium in long tubes should also be employed but care is needed to avoid mistaking small particles of precipitate for actual colonies of bacteria. To make certain of growth of microorganisms in semisolid medium, however, subplanting to a precipitate-free, dialysate medium is required. By following this method minute microorganisms which are obscured, or simulated, by precipitate in the Smith-Noguchi medium, can be identified.", "title": "STUDIES ON THE NASOPHARYNGEAL SECRETIONS FROM PATIENTS WITH COMMON COLDS.", "score": 68.3929672241211, "source": "medrag"}, {"doc_id": "pubmed23n0641_23581", "text": "1.

Hemihypertrophy is known to be associated with certain childhood tumors, most notably Wilms tumor (or nephroblastoma), and for this reason infants with hemihypertrophy are often followed with serial abdominal ultrasounds. Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome (KTS) is the triad of port-wine stain, venous varicosities, and soft tissue and/or bony hypertrophy. Children with KTS typically have localized rather than generalized hemihypertrophy, but occasionally the hypertrophy is more extensive than the vascular anomaly itself. Information is lacking about whether hemihypertrophy in this setting can also be a risk factor for Wilms tumor. We systematically reviewed the medical literature to determine whether well-documented cases of Wilms tumor in the setting of both hemihypertrophy and vascular anomalies have been described, and if found, whether the association was sufficiently frequent that routine screening for Wilms tumor in this setting should be recommended. A review of case reports and case series in the pediatric population was undertaken using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. We found 4 of 58 subjects with hemihypertrophy and Wilms tumor had a reported vascular anomaly, but in only one case was a clear-cut diagnosis of KTS confirmed. The relationship of the other three vascular anomalies reported was of uncertain significance. In conclusion, our review suggests that the risk of Wilms tumor in the setting of localized soft-tissue hypertrophy in conjunction with a vascular malformation is quite low. More extensive hemihypertrophy extending to body sites remote from the vascular malformation itself could have a higher risk of Wilms tumor, although the magnitude of this risk is uncertain.

I gave my boss an obituary I had written-I'm a features editor on Page One of The Wall Street Journal, so I certainly didn't want anybody else writing it-sent a note to my boss's boss and started saying my goodbyes. Last week, my doctor, Jerome E. Groopman, noticed that I am getting fat and said it wouldn't be a bad idea if I went on a modest diet. At age 53, I am going to the gym again.

Like other gay men, I had kept up with newspaper reports, beginning with a July 3, 1981, New York Times story with the fateful headline: \"Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals.\" Nevertheless, going to the baths was a big part of gay culture back then, and here I was. Old habits die hard. At the time, the federal Centers for Disease Control and medical authorities were saying little about this being an infectious disease. Indeed, they at first thought it probably wasn't. But it was pretty clear that GRID was caused either by the cumulative effects of too much sex (so many men, so many germs) or too much butyl nitrite (poppers), a sexual stimulant sniffed from little vials available for $5 at newsstands.

A probability calculus based on the corresponding hereditary factors of the joint ancestors establishes how likely homozygotes for hereditary diseases among the offspring of [blood]-related spouses - often cousins of the first or second degree - is.

Vitamin D-dependent rickets, type I results from abnormalities in the gene coding for 25(OH)D3-1-alpha-hydroxylase, and type II results from defective vitamin D receptors. The vitamin D-resistant types are familial hypophosphatemic rickets and hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria.

Mothers who breastfeed exclusively need to be informed of the recommendation to give their infants vitamin D supplements beginning in the first two months of life to prevent nutritional rickets. Vitamin D-dependent rickets, type I is treated with vitamin D; management of type II is more challenging.

Two tenets widely expressed by prenatal GHC professionals are: (1) they should never attempt to influence the outcome of a pregnancy, and (2) they should only use non-directive genetic counseling techniques. From a PH perspective, these tenets could be viewed in some instances as counterproductive and contrary to a major goal of PH (i.e., to improve the health and well-being of all residents, including newborns). For example, PH's message regarding fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) prevention is clear: If you are pregnant, don't drink; and if you drink, don't get pregnant. PH's message regarding neural tube defect (NTD) prevention is equally clear: all women of childbearing age who are capable of becoming pregnant should consume 0.4 mg of folic acid daily to reduce the risk of NTDs. In the past, issues such as eugenics, abortion of affected fetuses, and a lack of methods for the primary prevention of birth defects and genetic disorders have caused GHC providers to perform genetic counseling according to the two tenets mentioned above. Clearly, there are no moral or ethical reasons why children who are at risk for FAS, NTDs, fetal rubella syndrome, or many other conditions should not have the opportunity to be born healthy. Also, we know of no laws that prohibit providers from telling a woman to do something to improve her baby's chance of being born healthy. In our opinion, it is time for prenatal GHC professionals to re-examine the two tenets noted above on a case-by-case basis to determine when it is appropriate to use directive counseling techniques to improve reproductive outcomes in accordance with the goals of PH.

Although the acute cutaneous manifestations can be painful and troublesome, the most important consequence of herpes zoster (shingles) is the chronic pain syndrome known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Previous studies have suggested that declining varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses account for the increased frequency of herpes zoster seen in older adults. This led to the idea that immunization designed to boost VZV-specific CMI responses might reduce the risk of herpes zoster. This hypothesis was tested in a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial called the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS). Compared with the placebo group, herpes zoster vaccine recipients had a 61.1% reduction in zoster \"burden of illness\" (an index incorporating incidence and severity of herpes zoster); a 66.5% reduction in the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia; and a 51.3% reduction in the incidence of herpes zoster. The incidence of serious adverse events was not different between the overall vaccine and placebo populations. The most frequently encountered adverse event among vaccine recipients was local reactogenicity, with self-limited and generally mild tenderness, warmth, or erythema occurring at the injection site in about one-half of vaccine recipients. The zoster vaccine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2006 and is indicated for prevention of herpes zoster in immunocompetent persons aged 60 years and older.

The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies. The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a\n\t\t\t\t\tmalignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented.\n\t\t\t\t\tAffected people who have only bacterial infections have a better prognosis than those with additional complications and can have nearly normal life expectancy. This is especially the case if they are diagnosed early and begin treatment soon after the onset of symptoms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2. In some cases, abnormal growth of small nodules of lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia) may occur. In addition, an increased percent of individuals with CVID are more prone to developing certain forms of cancer than the general population such as\n\t\t\t\t\tmalignancies of lymphatic tissue (lymphoma) and possibly stomach cancer). The risk of gastric carcinoma is almost 50 times greater in patients with CVID than in other individuals.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn addition, some individuals with CVID may develop granular, inflammatory nodules (noncaseating granulomas) within tissue of the skin, lungs, spleen, and/or liver.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Of the 411 subjects with known follow-up (87% of the cohort), 93 patients (19.6%) had died.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe median age at death was 44 years for females (range 10-90 years) and 42 years for\n\t\t\t\t\tmales (range 9-79 years), not significantly different.

In order to find an answer to this historical question, the Emperor's biographies, the literature on laryngology published in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, German manuals on laryngology and ENT, the BMJ and Lancet were thoroughly studied where in particular not only Mackenzie but also Virchow had published several articles on the disease of Friedrich III. Prof. Gerhardt had decided not to perform biopsies of the tumor. Furthermore, he did not perform iodine potassium treatment ex juvantibus as it was common practice at that time in order to confirm the diagnosis of carcinoma by excluding syphilitic gumma. So Mackenzie was perfectly right when insisting on performing excisional biopsy before surgery. It is tragedy that Virchow by making the diagnosis of pachydermia laryngis provided the justification for canceling the surgical intervention that had already been decided. It was also mistake that Prof. Gerhardt did not accompany the Crown Prince during his stay in England in summer 1887. The authority of the delegated medical officer Dr. Landgraf did not suffice to persuade Mackenzie to discuss again the matter of performing surgery together with Gerhardt and von Bergmann.

The refusal of new consultations with Gerhardt and von Bergmann by Mackenzie can only be explained by the fact that Mackenzie was generally against such a surgical intervention. Regarding the question of the chances of such a surgery it can be said that thyrotomy and laryngectomy had been refused by the majority of laryngologists since the Congress of London in 1881 and the publication of P. v. Bruns in 1878. In Berlin, however, the improvement of surgical and anesthetic techniques by E. Hahn led to a positive opinion. F. Semon, who had strictly refused thyrotomy until 1886, supported the indication of thyrotomy of the Crown Prince since Hahn had successfully operated one of his patients in London. So the chance of healing a limited carcinoma of the vocal folds by thyrotomy was given. However, it may be questioned if partial resection had the desired outcome. The limited mobility of the left vocal fold that had been diagnosed already in May 1887 indicates that probably laryngectomy would have been necessary. The prognosis of this procedure, however, was extremely poor at that time. It is irony of history that T. Gluck who performed the separation of the airways from the digestive pathways in an animal model already in 1880 under von Langenbeck could not further develop his technique under von Bergmann. The Crown Prince acquired his disease at a time when the acceptance of surgical treatment of laryngeal carcinomas had reached its lowest point. Ten years later, the technique of thyrotomy was successfully established by Hahn, Butlin, and Semon so that Morell Mackenzie would probably have agreed to the intervention. Ten years later, due to Gluck and Sörensen, even the technique of laryngectomy had reached the performance that is still valid today so that the Emperor could have been treated successfully even with an advanced laryngeal carcinoma.", "title": "The laryngeal disease of the German Emperor Friedrich III: treatment failure or fateful course.", "score": 64.94490051269531, "source": "medrag"}, {"doc_id": "pubmed23n0043_16924", "text": "The diagnostic and operative management of thyroid cancer is controversial as the nature of the disease is heterogeneous in its growth rate, pattern of spread, and histological type.

Gender differences describe the biological variability between women and men, which is, in turn, related to differences in the information contained in sex chromosomes, the specific gene expression of autosomes linked to sex, the different number and quality of sex hormones, and their different effects on systems and organs, without neglecting the fact that each of the sexes has different target organs on which these hormones act. Additionally, both genders undergo metabolic changes throughout their lives, and this is especially true for women who show more dramatic changes due to their role in reproduction. Gender differences are not only the result of our genetic makeup but are also mixed with socio-cultural habits, behaviors, and lifestyles, differences between women and men, exposure to specific environmental influences, different food and lifestyle styles or stress, or different attitude in compliance with treatments and disease prevention campaigns. Gender differences also affect behavior throughout life, and physical changes can have implications for lifestyle, social roles, and mental health.

The last century has been characterised by remarkable advances in our understanding of the mechanisms leading to hyperglycaemia. The central role of insulin in glucose metabolism regulation was clearly demonstrated during the early 1920s, when Banting, Best, Collip and Macleod successfully reduced blood glucose levels and glycosuria in a patient treated with a substance purified from bovine pancreata. Later, during the mid-1930s, clinical observations suggested a possible distinction between 'insulin-sensitive' and 'insulin-insensitive' diabetes. Only during the 1950s, when a reliable measure of circulating insulin was available, was it possible to translate these clinical observations into pathophysiological and biochemical differences, and the terms 'insulin-dependent' (indicating undetectable insulin levels) and 'non-insulin-dependent' (normal or high insulin levels) started to emerge. The next 30 years were characterised by pivotal progress in the field of immunology that were instrumental in demonstrating an immune-mediated loss of insulin-secreting β-cells in subjects with 'insulin-dependent' diabetes. At the same time, new experimental techniques allowing measurement of insulin 'impedance' showed a reduced peripheral effect of insulin in subjects with 'non-insulin-dependent' diabetes (insulin resistance). The difference between the two types of diabetes emerging from decades of observations and experiments was further formally recognised in 1979, when the definitions 'type I' and 'type II' diabetes were introduced to replace the former 'insulin-dependent' and 'non-insulin-dependent' terms. In the following years, many studies elucidated the natural history and temporal contribution of insulin resistance and β-cell insulin secretion in 'type II' diabetes. Furthermore, a central role for insulin resistance in the development of a cluster of cardiometabolic alterations (dyslipidaemia, inflammation, high blood pressure) was suggested. Possibly as a consequence of the secular changes in diabetes risk factors, in the last 10 years the limitation of a simple distinction between 'type I' and 'type II' diabetes has been increasingly recognised, with subjects showing the coexistence of insulin resistance and immune activation against β-cells. With the advancement of our cellular and molecular understanding of diabetes, a more pathophysiological classification that overcomes the historical and simple 'glucocentric' view could result in a better patient phenotyping and therapeutic approach.

Deleterious changes to metabolism can lead to type II diabetes and atherosclerosis and other organ dysfunctions. It has long been recognized that there are two main types of fatty tissue in the body, white adipose tissue (WAT) serving a storage function and brown adipose tissue (BAT) serving a thermogenic function. The new discovery has been that WAT cells can be induced to undergo conversion (browning) to BAT to yield what is called beige adipose tissue, acquiring the thermogenic function.

Surveys of antidepressant users suggest 30-50% have no evidence-based indication to continue, but coming off antidepressants is often difficult due to fears of relapse, withdrawal symptoms and a lack of psychological treatments to replace maintenance treatment and prevent relapse. GPs should not prescribe antidepressants routinely for mild depressive/anxiety symptoms. Patients starting antidepressants should be advised that they are to be taken for a limited period only, and that there is a risk of withdrawal problems on stopping them. Prescribers should actively review long-term antidepressant use and suggest coming off them slowly to patients who are well. The relationship between SSRI dose and serotonin transporter receptor occupancy suggests that hyperbolic tapering regimes may be helpful for patients with troubling withdrawal symptoms who cannot stop treatment within 4-8 weeks, and tapering strips can allow carefully titrated slower dose reduction over some months.

Consistent with this, supplements do acutely reduce bone resorption and produce small short-term effects on bone density, without evidence of a cumulative density benefit.

This must be balanced against an increase in gastrointestinal side effects (including a doubling of hospital admissions for these problems), a 17% increase in renal calculi and a 20-40% increase in risk of myocardial infarction.

Pus cultures obtained from cases of TOAPOT grew mixed or single organisms. Detailed histopathologic studies in tubal specimens after the failure of an occlusion procedure are available from cases with no infection.

Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia\n\t\t\t\t\tassociated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and\n\t\t\t\t\tsperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome\n\t\t\t\t\tarchitecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1).

In conclusion, 1 month of metformin administration to patients with essential hypertension and normal glucose tolerance 1) reduces the basal plasma insulin concentration, 2) improves whole body insulin-mediated glucose utilization, and 3) improves plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

This review examines the current literature regarding the nonglycemic effects and potential novel indications for metformin. Review of the literature, with a focus on metformin use in Stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD-3) and heart failure (HF). The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study suggests that metformin reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, and more recent retrospective studies have shown an association between metformin use and a reduction in stroke, atrial fibrillation and all-cause mortality. The mechanism(s) explaining these putative benefits are not clear but may involve decreased energy intake (with attendant weight loss), improvement in lipids, and lowering of blood pressure; a literature review suggests that metformin lowers blood pressure when it is elevated, but not when it is normal. Metformin appears to be safe when given to patients with CKD-3. In addition, there is evidence that individuals with CKD-3, who are at increased cardiovascular risk, stand to benefit from metformin therapy. Lactic acidosis is an extremely remote and probably avoidable risk; measurement of plasma metformin levels and more frequent monitoring of renal function may be useful in selected patients with CKD-3 who are treated with metformin. Finally, there is evidence that metformin is safe in patients with HF; metformin therapy is associated with a reduction in newly incident HF and in HF mortality.

This combination has been developed to respond to a series of unmet needs in the practical management of patients undergoing cataract surgery. Namely, despite updated guidelines, many ophthalmologists employ protocols mainly based on their personal experience. As a result, the choice of drugs, treatment duration, and drug association is not evidence-based medicine (EBM)-oriented. In addition, antibiotic resistance may occur since antibiotics are used for an extended length of time, even with tapering. Corticosteroids are also prescribed for prolonged periods, frequently without follow-up. Therefore, patient adherence to postsurgical self-care is low, and mainly affects older patients who are the majority undergoing cataract surgery. In both rabbit and human trials, it has been demonstrated that both active ingredients penetrate the ocular system without pharmacokinetic interaction between the two. The concentrations of both ingredients in aqueous humor after their ocular instillation are high enough at the site of action to carry out their expected potent anti-inflammatory and antibiotic activity. Tested in a pivotal study aimed at investigating efficacy and safety of the intended indication, the mixture/compound was non-inferior to a 2-week treatment with dexamethasone/tobramycin in preventing or reducing inflammation and in preventing infection when administered for 1 week, followed by the administration of dexamethasone alone for another week. The outcomes obtained by this study suggest that a 1-week course of levofloxacin/dexamethasone eye drops is sufficient to resolve inflammation and prevent infection in patients undergoing cataract surgery.

The detachment of cancer cells from their parent tumors is an initial early event in metastasis. The site of detachment with respect to proximity to blood vessels may determine the initial dissemination route. Many factors affect cell detachment; we specifically consider the effects of growth-rate, necrosis, enzyme activity, and stress on cell release in terms of metastasis-promoting mechanisms. Detachment is also discussed in relation to active cancer cell locomotion, where localized detachment from the substratum is a prerequisite for translatory movement. The importance of active cell movement in tissue invasion has only recently been assessed, and, in the case of at least some human malignant melanomas, a zone of actively moving cancer cells is believed to precede the growing body of the tumor. The secondary release of cancer cells from temporary arrest sites at the vascular endothelium consequent upon intravascular dissemination is also a major area of investigation. Circulating cancer cells arrest at vascular endothelium or are impacted in small vessels, however, most are released into the circulation and subsequently perish. The blood stream is a hostile environment, and it is probable that cancer cells are sufficiently damaged in translocation by hemodynamic trauma and humoral factors such that they easily detach or are 'sheared-off' the vascular endothelium by blood flow. Another possibility is that in some cases they are processed by 'first organ encounters' and perish before or shortly after arriving in a second organ. Animal studies have shown that, following intravenous injection, 60-100% of the injected dose of viable cancer cells are initially arrested in the lungs, but very few remain after 24 hr. As it is only those retained cells which produce tumors, the mechanisms involved in this secondary release, which occurs in all organs so far examined, are critical to any understanding of the metastatic cascade and metastatic inefficiency. The arrest of cancer cells at the vascular endothelium and their subsequent release have been associated with the presence of platelets, and the deposition of fibrin and manipulation of platelet-aggregating mechanisms and fibrinolysis are discussed in terms of their antimetastatic effects. The role of the reticuloendothelial system, natural killer cells, and polymorphs is discussed in relation to cancer cell clearance from blood vessels and also to inherent cancer cell properties which may act to inhibit their metastasis.

Tumor cells arrested in a target organ were in close contact with vascular endothelial cells and further with basement membrane when the endothelial linings were removed. In some regions we found junction-like structures between these cells. This appeared to be corresponding to the lodgement of tumor cells in the target organ. Extravasated tumor cells produced three different features of metastatic lesions in the combination of tumor strain and the organ affected; formation of tumor nodules accompanying neovasculature, spreading of tumor cells along the perivascular tissue of an organ, and diffuse infiltration of tumor cells in an organ.

The latter basically consists of blood-borne cancer cells which are in close association with platelets. At the site of the primary tumor, the blood components reach the TME via leaky blood vessels, whose permeability is increased by tumor-secreted growth factors, by incomplete angiogenic sprouts or by vasculogenic mimicry (VM) vessels. As a consequence, platelets reach the primary tumor via several cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). Moreover, clotting factor VII from the blood associates with tissue factor (TF) that is abundantly expressed on cancer cells. This extrinsic tenase complex turns on the coagulation cascade, which encompasses the activation of thrombin and conversion of soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin. The presence of platelets and their release of growth factors, as well as fibrin deposition changes the TME of a solid tumor mass substantially, thereby promoting tumor progression. Disseminating cancer cells that circulate in the blood stream also recruit platelets, primarily by direct cell-cell interactions via different receptor-counterreceptor pairs and indirectly by fibrin, which bridges the two cell types via different integrin receptors. These tumor cell-platelet aggregates are hematogenous micrometastases, in which platelets and fibrin constitute a particular TME in favor of the cancer cells. Even at the distant site of settlement, the accompanying platelets help the tumor cell to attach and to grow into metastases.

Secondary prevention of GI malignancies through early detection and treatment of cancer-precursor/premalignant lesions, therefore, is recognized as an effective cancer prevention strategy. In order to efficiently detect these lesions, systemic application of screening tests (surveillance) is needed. However, most of the currently used non-invasive screening tests for GI malignancies (for example, serum markers such as alpha-fetoprotein for hepatocellular carcinoma, and fecal occult blood test, for colon cancer) are only modestly effective necessitating the use of highly invasive endoscopy-based procedures, such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy for screening purposes. Even for hepatocellular carcinoma where non-invasive imaging (ultrasonography) has become a standard screening tool, the need for repeated liver biopsies of suspicious liver nodules for histopathological confirmation can't be avoided. The invasive nature and high-cost associated with these screening tools hinders implementation of GI cancer screening programs. Moreover, only a small fraction of general population is truly predisposed to developing GI malignancies, and indeed needs surveillance. To spare the average-risk individuals from superfluous invasive procedures and achieve an economically viable model of cancer prevention, it's important to identify cohorts in general population that are at substantially high risk of developing GI malignancies (risk-stratification), and select suitable screening tests for surveillance in these cohorts.

For each patient the risk/benefit ratio of the strategy must therefore be evaluated as much as possible (double procedure at once, or bypass followed by surveillance of the aortic stenosis). In order to do this it is necessary to consider, apart from the stenosis progression factors, the patient's life expectancy and point of view, as well as of course the operative risk (LV function, comorbidity...).

Aortic stenosis is now most commonly due to a bicuspid valve. Rheumatic aortic stenosis has become much less common and calcific stenosis of valves in the elderly is a rapidly increasing cause. The prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis can be largely determined by their symptoms, with a mean length of survival of 3 to 5 years for patients with angina, 3 years for patients with syncope, and only 12 to 24 months for patients with heart failure. Virtually all symptomatic patients should be operated on, even those with reduced left ventricular function. The risk of sudden death in asymptomatic adults is low, and thus surgery is generally not needed in these cases. Recently, the noninvasive diagnosis of aortic stenosis has improved dramatically with the advent of two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography. These techniques provide information on the pressure gradient and can even allow accurate estimates of valve area. Cardiac catheterization is still required, however, to determine the anatomy of the coronary arteries prior to surgery since many patients will have concomitant coronary artery disease.

When myocardial adaption is exhausted, surgical intervention is urgent, the prognosis, however, is already limited. To quantify the hemodynamic severity of aortic stenosis, transaortic pressure gradients (dp) measured by Doppler echocardiography or hemodynamically are inappropriate, because dp is significantly dependent on the transaortic flow volume. In severe aortic stenosis, despite constant narrowing of the aortic valve area, the reduced stroke volume results in decreasing transaortic pressure gradients. With aortic valve resistance or transaortic pressure loss (PL)--the quotient of pressure gradient and stroke volume--the hemodynamic severity of aortic stenosis can be described accurately. If PL is known, a decompensated aortic stenosis (PL &gt; 1 mm Hg/ml) may be differentiated from myocardial failure of another etiology and a concomitant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. With respect to medical therapy, the prevention of bacterial endocarditis and thromboembolic complications is important. Knowing the potential danger of syncopies and ventricular arrhythmias during exercise with increasing severity of aortic stenosis, patients have to be informed about their limited functional capacity. The occurrence of typical symptoms during the natural history of chronic aortic stenosis (e.g. dizziness, syncopes, angina pectoris, arrhythmias) manifestation of ST-T-alterations or silent myocardial ischemias and demonstration of an inadequate myocardial adaptation to the chronic pressure overload in asymptomatic patients are accepted indications for a surgical intervention. If the indication for surgery remains uncertain, stress tests (e.g. radionuclidventriculography) may be performed to demonstrate an exhausted myocardial adaptation. If the PL and the severity of aortic valve/anulus calcification is known, the progression of a chronic aortic stenosis can be estimated. This might be important, if a cardiosurgical intervention has to be performed for other indications and aortic stenosis is co-existent but does not require an intervention at that time.

Proliferation and differentiation of granulocytic and monocytic progenitor and immature cells have been studied in detail and are regulated by stimulatory and inhibitory molecules produced and released from the progeny of the progenitor cells. The resultant interactions between cells and cell-derived molecules suggest operable positive and negative feed-back mechanisms during normal hematopoiesis, and what one sees in the end is the net result of these interactions. The complexities of cellular regulation are partially unravelled by physical separation of the different populations and biochemical analysis of the regulatory molecules. Subpopulations of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (CFU-c) exist and evidence suggests that they vary in responsiveness to different molecules. Stimulatory molecules are themselves chemically and physically heterogenous and, until recently, believed to have similar biological actions, but this concept must be re-evaluated. Different molecules may activate different subsets of progenitor cells, and there is now a role for substances which enhance the stimulatory interactions. Many studies on normal and leukemic cell responsiveness to stimulation must be re-examined in light of this recent information. Several inhibitory substances operate during normal hematopoiesis. Mature granulocytes, progeny of CFU-c, appear to elaborate at least two inhibitory activities. One activity influences immature, recognizable granulocytes and the other indirectly reduces progenitor cell proliferation by decreasing the production and release of molecules which stimulate CFU-c. In addition, mononuclear phagocytes produce and release E-type prostaglandins in direct response to elevated levels of the stimulatory molecules and E-type prostaglandins counteract increased stimulatory levels by decreasing the sensitivity of CFU-c to stimulators. Much of our present level of sophistication derives from in vitro experimentation and it is apparent that we are only beginning to understand these inter-relationships and their relevance to the in vivo situation. However, these in vitro studies have shed light on the interactions occurring during leukemia. Leukemic cells retain the capacity to respond to normal regulators and must therefore be considered dependent rather than autonomous neoplasms. Abnormalities do exist in leukemic cell interactions: the progenitor cells themselves may be defective and leukemic cells may respond to molecules which normal cells do not. The degree of sensitivity to stimulators and inhibitors will have to be carefully investigated to determine if and what differences may exist between normal and leukemic cells.

There were significant temperature excursions below 15 degrees C at all locations, ranging from 16% to 90% of the total time. At one location, there were temperature readings below 0 degrees C for 9% of the total time. The mean kinetic temperatures obtained from the electronic recorders and the indicator labels differed by less than 1 degrees C. This study demonstrates that out-of-hospital medications are subject to temperatures both above and below recommended storage temperatures. Time-temperature indicator labels can reliably monitor exposure to elevated temperatures.", "title": "Storage temperatures of out-of-hospital medications.", "score": 65.8904037475586, "source": "medrag"}, {"doc_id": "pubmed23n0629_642", "text": "To describe (a) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and guidelines issued by several professional organizations to ensure appropriate storage, handling, and distribution of temperature-controlled prescription drugs from manufacturer to wholesaler to pharmacy to patients; (b) pharmacy business practices that ensure the dispensing of high-quality temperature-controlled drug products; and (c) education that facilitates patients' important role in maintaining product quality.

Additional resources were identified from bibliographies collected by the authors. Relevant data were extracted independently by the authors. The important role of pharmacists in ensuring the quality of drugs dispensed to and handled/stored by patients is supported by business practices that (a) promote purchase of quality temperature-controlled drugs (including quality agreements with providers), (b) ensure appropriate handling and storage upon receipt, (c) ensure proper packaging for receipt by patients, (d) provide relevant information to patients, and (e) evaluate issues associated with possible compromised transit, handling, and storage of temperature-controlled drug products. The transit, handling, and storage of temperature-controlled drug products within complex supply chains provide opportunities for exposure of such drugs to temperatures above or below those recommended by the manufacturer. Pharmacists have opportunities to integrate business practices that facilitate the proper receipt, handling, and storage of temperature-controlled drug products. These practices will enhance the dispensing of high-quality, efficacious drug products to patients and proper handling and storage by patients.", "title": "Integration of temperature-controlled requirements into pharmacy practice.", "score": 65.84144592285156, "source": "medrag"}, {"doc_id": "pubmed23n1015_13360", "text": "Although several studies confirmed a wide distribution of pharmaceuticals in rivers and streams, a limited knowledge is available about the partitioning of pharmaceuticals between the water phase and suspended particulate matter (SPM). To close this gap of knowledge, we developed and validated a sensitive and high throughput analytical method for the analysis of 57 pharmaceuticals, 42 metabolites and transformation products (TP) as well as the artificial sweetener acesulfame sorbed to SPM. The method was based on pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) followed by a clean-up via solvent exchange and detection via direct injection-reversed phase LC-MS/MS and freeze-drying-HILIC-MS/MS. Freundlich isotherms were determined for 90 analytes. All showed a linear sorption behavior. Distribution coefficients (K<subd</sub) ranged from 0.64 L/kg to 9300 L/kg. For 18 pharmaceuticals, K<subd</sub values were found to be above 100 L/kg. SPM of annual composite samples were analyzed to determine the pharmaceutical concentrations between 2005 and 2015 at four sites of the river Rhine: Weil, Iffezheim, Koblenz and Bimmen as well as between 2006 and 2015 at one site of the river Saar, at Rehlingen. In these SPM samples, up to 61 of the 100 analytes were detected with concentrations up to 190 ng/g d.w. (dry weight) for guanylurea, a transformation product of the antidiabetic metformin. For most analytes, increasing concentrations were found along the length of the Rhine and higher concentrations were measured in Rehlingen/Saar. Normalization of the data with the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine as an intrinsic tracer for municipal wastewater indicated possible industrial discharges for four analytes. For most pharmaceuticals, the annual concentrations exhibited a good correlation with the consumption volumes in Germany.", "title": "Spatial distribution and temporal trends of pharmaceuticals sorbed to suspended particulate matter of German rivers.", "score": 65.7893295288086, "source": "medrag"}], "retrieved_images": []}
