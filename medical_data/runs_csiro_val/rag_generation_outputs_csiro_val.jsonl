Apparently she had an allergic reaction to peanuts--something she was never allergic to before. She felt better, but then picked up mono from school probably a week later. She was saying she felt tired all the time and that her senses were all out of wack. Within that two week period she ended up in the ER again, first time for fatigue but was sent home and was told that the fatigue was from mono and that it would pass. \n\nThe second time to the ER was worse--this time she was airlifted to one of the best hospitals in the country but no one could figure out what was wrong, except only that her health was declining fast. Her liver was no longer functioning, hundreds of tests were performed and the only thing that came back positive was mono. Her brain swelled up so bad that it herniated to her spine causing her to lose all body function and at that point lost all brain activity. The only thing keeping her alive was epinephrine, two other drugs and life support. She died 24 hours later where family and friends were notified to come visit to say goodbye.\n\nThe family has agreed to an autopsy but we are devasted on how sudden and fast her health deteriorated so quickly and are at a loss of how this was not prevented.

This decline was independent of age, sex, and duration of symptom in people included in the studies. \n           Conclusions  A high rate of misdiagnosis of conversion symptoms was reported in early studies but this rate has been only 4% on average in studies of this diagnosis since 1970.

When I was in my teens it was once every few months and I would treat with monastat 1. When monastat 1 stopped working I moved one to monastat 3. Then 5. Then 7. Then it stopped being effective all together. After monastat stopped working I would go the the gyno to have her prescribe me antibiotics. I can't remember what she would prescribe, but it worked and I wouldn't have a yeast infection for a few months until it came back. I started coming in so frequently for the problem with no long term solution, eventually my doctor yelled at me for coming back for the same problem so often, told me to tell my boyfriend to clean his penis better (had no boyfriend at the time) and gave me the roughest pap smear I've ever had. I never went back. \nI switched doctors when I was 20 to this lovely amazing women who was determined to find a long term solution for me. She gave so much information and I followed all of her advice. After 2 appointments with her, she prescribed me fluconazole to take on day one, then 3 days later. She also gave me 4 refills at a time so I wouldn't have to go to the doctor everytime I had a yeast infection since they were so frequent and I could tell when I was getting one easily. Unfortunately that doctor died in a plane crash before we could find a solution. \nI was given a new doctor (male) in the same practice who is nice, and took over the prescription refill for the fluconazole. He told me he wanted to try a preventative method and I took fluconazole once a week for 6 months. I noticed in the last 2 months of treatment I had a very minor yeast infection, not bad enough for me to be in major discomfort, but noticeable. \nThat's where I am now. The 6 month preventative treatment is done, I'm worried to make an appointment with my doctor because I'm afraid that he won't have an answer. I'm just tired of trying so many different things with no results. Over the span of 12 years I've tried changing soaps (for my vagina), using no soap, using baby wash (what I use currently) and using feminine wash. I've changed my diet (no added sugar, no bread). I wear only cotton underwear and sleep without underwear or bottoms. \nAt this point I'm just worried that I'm resistant to the antibiotics I'm taking, and since I have no kids and want to, I'm worried if this will affect it. And I know that yeast infections are more common in pregnant women, what if by the time get pregnant get an uncurable yeast infection? \n\nSO my question is, has anyone had any experience personally or with patients that this happened? Is there a new treatment I should talk to my doctor about or something I can try personally? Any advice would be appreciated. \nThanks for reading \n\nTLDR; frequent yeast infections for the last 12 years with no long term solution after trying multiple things.

Less commonly, foot dystonia may mimic foot drop, as occurs with weakness of the dorsiflexors muscles, resulting in a pseudo foot drop. This has rarely been reported in the literature and has been poorly recognized, often leading to misdiagnosis and unnecessary investigations and treatment. We report 5 patients with dystonic pseudo foot drop, one of them diagnosed with early‐onset  PD , 2 with sporadic  PD , and 2 with dystonia. Despite the steppage gait, their physical exam revealed normal strength, and no other explanation for a “foot drop” was found.

Fast forward to 8 years later and I got another xray (wouldn't allow me to attach picture... idk why). My new chiropractor told me that they are in fact NOT fused, and have been degenerating for years. I have never had a back injury so he suggested maybe I was born with very little cushioning between my vertebrae and that it just worsened over the years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, he told me that I will need $4000 worth of treatment and life long weekly adjustments to fix some of the damage and improve my back. Should I trust him or should I seek an MDs advice and possibly get treatment that I am insured for? Thanks!", "gt_answer": "Seek an MD/DO.

If there is a more suitable subreddit for me to post this in, please let me know.\n\nI am a 59 year old female. Currently 5’8” , 168 lbs. I never got my period as a young girl, and the combination of my mother being really Catholic and not prone to seeing doctors unless it was an emergency made my “condition” not really discussed or worried about, since it was an awkward subject. But I spent my entire adolescence wondering why I didn’t menstruate like the other girls, and feeling very left out and different. I did develop secondary sex characteristics, but I would give myself a IV on the Tanner scale. I also remember getting hot flashes when I was about 12 or 13 and didn’t understand what was happening.\n\nBy the time I was a senior in college, I had my first serious boyfriend and became sexually active. Even though I didn’t get my period, I was afraid I still might somehow get pregnant and went to the campus gynecologist for birth control. He was concerned about the reason for the primary amenorrhea and ordered a karyotype test. He told me how expensive it was and said since I had medical insurance as a college student this was the time to do it.\n\nI remember it was quite a long time afterwards, I was already out of college by the time I heard anything. He called me and told me I would not be able to have children and I should have my ovaries removed because there was a chance they could become malignant. I don’t recall him ever giving me a name for what was wrong with me, or explaining what my karyotype test said. I never got a written test result. The call was somewhat shocking to me, and I know I didn’t really hear everything he said that day. And now almost 40 years later I remember even less.\n\nI went through a lot of my younger life without medical insurance and I never had regular gynecological care. By my mid 30s I began yearly physicals, but my GP at the time didn’t make a big issue about my lack of periods. He said since I had some breast development I had enough estrogen in my system to protect against osteoporosis. Eventually I began to see a gynecologist and she encouraged me to see if I could find the results of that karyotype test, but too much time had passed and the records were destroyed. She ordered a transvaginal ultrasound and it was discovered that I had streak ovaries. I have had DEXA scans that show osteopenia, and I took Evista for 10 years without it having much effect, so I stopped the Evista and just take calcium and vitamin D supplements and do weight bearing exercise now.\n\nI guess what I am seeking is if there is any way I can gather more clues about my condition without doing another karyotype test. At my age I can’t imagine my insurance approving the test, since there is no real purpose for me having it done, except for my own closure. My current GP and gynecologist both seem unconcerned with my condition. As a matter of fact, the PA at the gynecologist’s office regularly still asks me for the date of my last period. I have to explain each time that I don’t even have functioning ovaries. What if I had one of those genetic tests done like 23 and Me...is it possible that they could determine anomalies with my sex chromosomes? I am so sorry this was so long. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this.\n\nEdited to add:\nMy physical appearance might be helpful in giving some clues. I am slim hipped and small-breasted; I am shaped more like a toilet paper roll than an hourglass but I look unmistakably female. My ring fingers are both about 1cm longer than my index fingers. (I know that factor has some bearing on difference between the sexes.) I have no unusual characteristics, but my arms are quite long, my fingers are long and my shoulders just a little bit on the broad side. My feet are large also.

Fast forward two years and my moms ability to speak is almost entirely gone, and gotten worse in the past two months particularly.\n\nIt’s sounds like she is a baby or younger person and causes heavy sluring, essentially she’s lost all articulation and speed. Her mental ability is still 100% there, we’ve done multiple tests for memory, etc and she comes up in the higher percentiles for her age.\n\nShe writes me detailed letters that demonstrate her cognitive ability, no mental illness in the family.\n\nShe is 58, exercises daily (since college) and only eats healthy food. No smoking or drinking.\n\nShe is on the fifth doctor (CA) and they are starting from square 0 again with tests for ALS, dementia, etc.. but I have a feeling after another 6 months of testing we will find inconclusive results once again. As we have with all doctors (nobody can find what’s wrong).\n\nEDIT: a (belived urine, will confirm when know) test for rare micro toxins that were detected, my mother testing in the range of 608 ng/g for Mycophenolic  Acid, where the acceptable rate is roughly \\~38.

All the tests she passes and I just don’t know I just want hear her voice again.\n\nWhat can I do to get to the bottom of this?

Fast forward two years and my moms ability to speak is almost entirely gone, and gotten worse in the past two months particularly.\n\nIt’s sounds like she is a baby or younger person and causes heavy sluring, essentially she’s lost all articulation and speed. Her mental ability is still 100% there, we’ve done multiple tests for memory, etc and she comes up in the higher percentiles for her age.\n\nShe writes me detailed letters that demonstrate her cognitive ability, no mental illness in the family.\n\nShe is 58, exercises daily (since college) and only eats healthy food. No smoking or drinking.\n\nShe is on the fifth doctor (CA) and they are starting from square 0 again with tests for ALS, dementia, etc.. but I have a feeling after another 6 months of testing we will find inconclusive results once again. As we have with all doctors (nobody can find what’s wrong).\n\nEDIT: a (belived urine, will confirm when know) test for rare micro toxins that were detected, my mother testing in the range of 608 ng/g for Mycophenolic  Acid, where the acceptable rate is roughly \\~38. Please see this comment for more discussion on this:  [\n\nThere’s is nothing that has changed mentally for my mother outside the newly added stress (she is on disability for work because her job requires talking) but I’m loosing my mind watching my mother lose her ability to talk, and I don’t know what to do or where to look. All the tests she passes and I just don’t know I just want hear her voice again.\n\nWhat can I do to get to the bottom of this? We’ve spent so much on these studies that show up inconclusive, nobody is giving me solid advice, every doctor wants to test the same things again (which I understand as its due process), but I need to figure this out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ***********  Updates  *************\n\nMy mom first noticed her ability to speak leaving in 2017, this \"illness\" has been a gradual climb since then and is now rapidly accelerating into her not being able to speak anymore. She can barely communicate for 2-3hrs of the day at the moment and this number is dwindling.\n\nShe has/is attempting western medicine solutions, we are on a long chain of specialists and referrals that started around late 2017.\n\nShe also believes in trying homeopathic/eastern medicine options, hence the long list of supplements.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns is the high level of Mycophenolic  Acid that appeared in my mothers urine samples. She was not tested for Mycophenolic acid until after she had been on her supplements for roughly six-eight months, she started the supplements early 2019.\n\nShe moved homes in 2018, the home she moved into was torn down to the foundation (by her) and rebuilt (this process **finished** in 2018), before moving in the home was checked for mold and no results came back.

After the attempt I got a whole new appreciation for everything around me and before I even started the medication I felt more positive but I knew that may not last forever with my past history of self harm and depression. \n\nI understand that anti depressants are difficult to truly see if they work and my family said they saw a difference in me after the first couple months. Still I truly am unsure if it is the pill, the progress I made with my therapist, or both. \n\nMostly likely it is both but then how do I know when I should start to go off taking the Prozac. I think that I’ve been doing better and one less pill is a good thing to do, but it is a difficult idea to process especially since I don’t know how much it is really helping me.
