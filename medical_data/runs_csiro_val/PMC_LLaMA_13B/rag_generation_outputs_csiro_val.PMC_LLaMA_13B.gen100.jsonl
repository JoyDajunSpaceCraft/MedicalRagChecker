Apparently she had an allergic reaction to peanuts--something she was never allergic to before. She felt better, but then picked up mono from school probably a week later.

Her liver was no longer functioning, hundreds of tests were performed and the only thing that came back positive was mono. Her brain swelled up so bad that it herniated to her spine causing her to lose all body function and at that point lost all brain activity. The only thing keeping her alive was epinephrine, two other drugs and life support.

I never went back. \nI switched doctors when I was 20 to this lovely amazing women who was determined to find a long term solution for me.

None of these tests were remarkable.\n\nWe went to our ENT appointment for the dizziness and balance issues. She told us if she has inflammation in her ear it will go away with time, but there is no test she can perform to prove that's what's wrong and she also didn't seem convinced that was the cause.

She moves very slow and spaces out a lot. Almost like she's intoxicated. She acted this way last time she had a high fever, but she doesn't have a fever.\n-Very tired. She sleeps a lot and never seems well rested when she wakes up. She'll wake up in the morning, go to turn her light on and then stand there, then turn her light back off and go back to bed. Her naps have been much longer than usual.\n-She has issues swinging. She starts to look unwell, sometimes holds her head and asks to get out. I'm assuming she's getting dizziness but I am not certain.\n-She's squinting and sometimes she runs into walls like she can't balance or her depth perception is off. This doesn't happen all the time. Some days she's better.\n-I may have seen involuntary movement with her tongue and sometimes I think she has issues swallowing water. She'll swallow a lot of air which seems weird.\n-She seems to be worse after waking up. Especially the loopiness.\n\nWhat on earth could be going on with my baby?

Her symptoms seem to come and go, where some days she's almost normal and others she has no sense of balance and her behavior is abnormal. This is eating me up inside not knowing what's wrong with her.\n\nShe has had a Brain MRI without contrast, an EEG, a CT of her brain, hearing test, EKG, chest X-ray, urinalysis and extensive blood work. None of these tests were remarkable.\n\nWe went to our ENT appointment for the dizziness and balance issues. She told us if she has inflammation in her ear it will go away with time, but there is no test she can perform to prove that's what's wrong and she also didn't seem convinced that was the cause. She ordered an MRI of the spine. I also have an eye doctor appointment scheduled for next month.

She moves very slow and spaces out a lot. Almost like she's intoxicated. She acted this way last time she had a high fever, but she doesn't have a fever.\n-Very tired. She sleeps a lot and never seems well rested when she wakes up. She'll wake up in the morning, go to turn her light on and then stand there, then turn her light back off and go back to bed. Her naps have been much longer than usual.\n-She has issues swinging. She starts to look unwell, sometimes holds her head and asks to get out. I'm assuming she's getting dizziness but I am not certain.\n-She's squinting and sometimes she runs into walls like she can't balance or her depth perception is off. This doesn't happen all the time. Some days she's better.\n-I may have seen involuntary movement with her tongue and sometimes I think she has issues swallowing water. She'll swallow a lot of air which seems weird.\n-She seems to be worse after waking up. Especially the loopiness.\n\nWhat on earth could be going on with my baby?

I have been trying to lose weight and that is my goal, I am down to 275 from 320. I am wondering, is it at all possible for my liver to be in a cirrhotic state and or should I get another ultrasound? Would my CT scan have shown a cirrhotic liver in August? Do these ranges look concerning?\n\nReason for all of this is because I have felt a little bit of weird pressure in the top right and I don't know if it is in my head and my medical anxiety kicking in or what.\n\nMy GP has been great and he said he believes it is still a result of the fatty liver and said he doesn't think we should do more imaging at this time but I am wondering if I should request an ultra sound?

Unfortunately, the authors did not mention the time lag between the prick testing (whose findings were published in 2009) and the allergic reaction (1999) and it is further unclear whether the tested inks were similar to those applied a decade earlier. Also, hereditary angioedema as a possible cause had not been ruled out.

{"query_id": "47", "query": "This is going to be long, so thank you in advance for your patience. If there is a more suitable subreddit for me to post this in, please let me know.\n\nI am a 59 year old female. Currently 5’8” , 168 lbs. I never got my period as a young girl, and the combination of my mother being really Catholic and not prone to seeing doctors unless it was an emergency made my “condition” not really discussed or worried about, since it was an awkward subject. But I spent my entire adolescence wondering why I didn’t menstruate like the other girls, and feeling very left out and different. I did develop secondary sex characteristics, but I would give myself a IV on the Tanner scale. I also remember getting hot flashes when I was about 12 or 13 and didn’t understand what was happening.\n\nBy the time I was a senior in college, I had my first serious boyfriend and became sexually active. Even though I didn’t get my period, I was afraid I still might somehow get pregnant and went to the campus gynecologist for birth control. He was concerned about the reason for the primary amenorrhea and ordered a karyotype test. He told me how expensive it was and said since I had medical insurance as a college student this was the time to do it.\n\nI remember it was quite a long time afterwards, I was already out of college by the time I heard anything. He called me and told me I would not be able to have children and I should have my ovaries removed because there was a chance they could become malignant. I don’t recall him ever giving me a name for what was wrong with me, or explaining what my karyotype test said. I never got a written test result. The call was somewhat shocking to me, and I know I didn’t really hear everything he said that day. And now almost 40 years later I remember even less.\n\nI went through a lot of my younger life without medical insurance and I never had regular gynecological care. By my mid 30s I began yearly physicals, but my GP at the time didn’t make a big issue about my lack of periods. He said since I had some breast development I had enough estrogen in my system to protect against osteoporosis. Eventually I began to see a gynecologist and she encouraged me to see if I could find the results of that karyotype test, but too much time had passed and the records were destroyed. She ordered a transvaginal ultrasound and it was discovered that I had streak ovaries. I have had DEXA scans that show osteopenia, and I took Evista for 10 years without it having much effect, so I stopped the Evista and just take calcium and vitamin D supplements and do weight bearing exercise now.\n\nI guess what I am seeking is if there is any way I can gather more clues about my condition without doing another karyotype test. At my age I can’t imagine my insurance approving the test, since there is no real purpose for me having it done, except for my own closure. My current GP and gynecologist both seem unconcerned with my condition. As a matter of fact, the PA at the gynecologist’s office regularly still asks me for the date of my last period. I have to explain each time that I don’t even have functioning ovaries. What if I had one of those genetic tests done like 23 and Me...is it possible that they could determine anomalies with my sex chromosomes? I am so sorry this was so long. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this.\n\nEdited to add:\nMy physical appearance might be helpful in giving some clues. I am slim hipped and small-breasted; I am shaped more like a toilet paper roll than an hourglass but I look unmistakably female. My ring fingers are both about 1cm longer than my index fingers. (I know that factor has some bearing on difference between the sexes.) I have no unusual characteristics, but my arms are quite long, my fingers are long and my shoulders just a little bit on the broad side. My feet are large also.

In view of the possibility that her auditory hallucinations began after starting trazodone, trazodone was discontinued, leading to a complete resolution of her auditory hallucinations. Furthermore, even after risperidone was decreased and discontinued, her auditory hallucinations did not recur. These findings suggest that trazodone may induce auditory hallucinations in some susceptible patients.", "title": null, "score": 0.9290798902511597, "source": "csiro_faiss"}], "retrieved_images": []}
