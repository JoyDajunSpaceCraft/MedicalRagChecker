It’s been a long, 15 year  journey with my skin issues and I’m feeling hopeless this evening because through it all, I feel like I have made no real progress. \n\nI have acne, and I’m a 33 year old Caucasian female with fair, freckled combination skin. My acne started to get really bad about 10 years ago. I’ve tried numerous skincare routines/topical treatments. They didn’t work (although I’m not giving up on that front). Was on Minocycline for 2 years which initially worked somewhat, but it started declining in effectiveness after a year and eventually just stopped working entirely. Next, was Doxycycline which gave me the worst, month long yeast infection I’ve ever had and didn’t do much for my skin. \n\nFrom there - I stopped all acne medications for about 6 months in an effort to let my body recover from the 2 years of daily antibiotics, and let my skin go through whatever it needed to go through off meds in hopes it would clear up (naive aspirations...). I was hanging in there after 5 months of being med-free, until I picked up some kind of skin bacteria or fungus when I went camping. I had dry looking red patches on my face and In my scalp that itched. \n\nMy doctor wasn’t exactly sure what it was, but she prescribed me Bactrim. The minute I heard she was prescribing me another stronger antibiotic, I knew right away that it was going to clear my skin and got this guilty, excited feeling like the acne med junkie that I am. Well- I was right....it cleared up the mystery dry itchy spots on my face and hair(although one of the bigger mystery patches left a pretty sizable scar which was jolting), but it also just so happened to clear my entire face better than ANYTHING ever tried before. \n\nFor the first time in 10 years, I had next to 100% clear, glowing skin. It was such a good feeling. I could go makeup free for the first time in my life. The taste of freedom was too good, though... because I basically became addicted to Bactrim. I managed to get a couple more prescriptions for it and have been abusing the medication for 10 months, dragging out these last pills I have by taking half of a 75mg Bactrim (1/4 of the prescribed daily amount) per day. I know what I’m doing is not healthy or smart and I don’t want to cause a mutant bacteria growth/resistance within my system so I am stopping, this week. \n\nMy questions are - why are antibiotics the only thing that clears my skin? What does that say about my system and overall health? That I need to work on my gut flora/General gut health? Even the Bactrim at this point is starting to decline in effectiveness, the same issue with antibiotics in general.\n\nSome more info about my acne: I get all types of blemishes - closed commodones, blackheads, cystic acne and whiteheads, all over my face. The closed comodones are mainly on my forehead and jawline, cystic on my cheeks and cheekbones and also my chin, whiteheads pop up everywhere randomly, and in the last 2 years there’s been a surge of blackheads that come up literally all over my whole face. I’ve never had this many issues before. (The last time I saw my skin at its worst was 10 months ago before I started Bactrim) It got really bad before I started taking Bactrim and I’m dreading what I might be going through again. \n\nIm also worried about scarring - I’m 33 and my skin is not recovering from scarring as well as it used to. Lastly, diet info: I’ve ruled dairy out as a trigger by eliminating it from my diet for 2 months and seeing no improvement. And I am about to do the same with sugar. I’m hoping someone who’s been through something similar will read this and be able to give some guidance or support.

We went to the doctor constantly but they would just give him more ondansetron with instructions to avoid fatty foods.\n\nBut about 3 months ago, I noticed he was gaining MORE weight and he was developing jaundice.

His doctors didn't know the cause of the liver failure, but assumed because there was no cirrhosis and no evidence of cancer, he would recover.

Each cycle lasts from 90 minutes to 120 minutes. Once you wake up you have to go through all the stages again. Depending on which stage of these cycles your sleep is interrupted, you may wake up feeling very groggy, and repeated interruptions are scientifically proven to have an impact in long-term mental and physical health.

If you're interested in a difficult case, this one's for you.\n\nA month ago, I had lunch with some friends and ate a lot of dim sum. The dimsum was mostly steamed dumplings and noodles, nothing raw to my knowledge. Everyone else I ate with is also perfectly fine. I felt extremely bloated, and even after walking around all day after, the feeling didn't go away. The day after, I started getting some aching epigastric pain. It would happen before eating, and I would feel very bloated after eating anything. I assumed it was Gerd or gastritis, and took famotidine, Tums, omeprazole, none of which helped. I wasn't able to eat anything more than a few bites every meal, because of how full I felt. I went to the ER 3 days later, and they misdiagnosed me with cholecystitis. In the ER, my platelet count was low (93), hemoglobin and rbc low (10.3 and 3.19), bilirubin was high (1.8) but my white blood cell count was normal. They gave me Flagyl and Cipro to take, which actually stopped the pain but I also was on a liquid-only diet at this point.\n\nA week later, I went to a different hospital near my hometown. Was diagnosed with hepatosplenomegaly. My liver is currently 26.3 cm in craniocaudal dimension, spleen is 20.1cm. Did ultrasounds, a CT, and an MRI. Found nothing remarkable, except for a huge liver and spleen.\n\nIt's been a month now, and my symptoms are the same, except for darkened petechiae on my face and neck from low platelets. I've also been getting hot flashes and Charley horses at night. My bilirubin is now 2.2, and my liver and spleen are still enlarged. I'm still anemic. I've seen a gastroenterologist, an internist, a hepatologist, and have done tons of bloodwork and stool tests, with nothing remarkable. Mono was suspected for the longest time, but my tests were negative. Also ruled out Wilson's, lupus, hepatitis. My physician wants to do a liver biopsy next, but I doubt they will find anything there either.\n\nI'm honestly so tired of being tired all day and not having a treatment for this. No one can seem to figure out what's causing this, and it is not improving on its own. I can only walk for \\~30 minutes without feeling exhausted, still can't eat much, and feel full all the time.

As title says, during the past 2 years, I have had over 20 abscesses (more than 1 inch) surgically removed. These abscesses never form a head and they lie under my skin, so there's no way I pop them or whatever, it needs to be opened surgically. These abscesses are so painful that I can't do anything regularly. I can't have a normal job, I couldn't go to school properly, I was always either depressed about one that was forming or in so much pain that I couldn't move properly. Most of these occur in my buttcheeks but I've had one in the back of my head, one in my armpit and recently I had two big ones in each side of my scrotum area (which was by far the most complicated ones to remove, I had to be hospitalized for 2 days each and put on general/spinal anesthesia). The ones on my buttcheeks and armpit were removed as soon as I went into ER and I didn't need to stay the night at the hospital. I stopped getting them like 3 months ago but suddenly I got 3 of them... yes, three at the same time. Two on each side of my buttcheeks and one on the side of my scrotum, so basically I cannot sit/stand/walk without pain. All of them have been surgically removed but I am still in pain because of the packing and removing/inserting wick daily which is insanely painful.\n\nDoctors have no idea what it is, they always tell me it's an ingrown hair or it's in my genetics that there's no cure or something like that. They just gave me antibiotics and they are done with me until the next time. I've never had pus tested until I had to beg the doctor to test. I've had my blood tested, no diabetes, normal chlolesterol, etc.. During my last visit to the operating theatre, I begged the doctor to take a pus swab to see if we can find a way to end this but I don't know if this will help at all but we'll get the results in 3 weeks. I don't know what type of infection/disease I have. I have been researching the internet and I've found about MRSA and HS but I don't know if this is my diagnosis. I literally don't know what to do guys, I am depressed because I know I'll get more of these, they won't stop until I find the cause. Everytime one starts to form, I take a trip to the hospital and I've been put on amoxicillin 1000/ciproquin and metronidazole so many times, they don't work but they give it to me even if I tell them that they don't work and I always have to end up waiting for it to get bigger so that I can have it surgically removed. This is a very painful condition and when I got 3 at the same time, I was preparing for an interview that I really needed as I need a job badly but unfortunately I was hospitalized.

I took her to the emergency room twice in Corpus Christi, and twice in our home town as well. The doctors at he hospital initially thought it was a sunburn that was very bad. Her hands reacted horribly to the cream and treatment given to her. The welling got worse and we lost sight of her knuckles completely. By the time we got back home and I took her to the hospital she was vomiting and running a high fever. \n\n The doctors at home still didn't know what it was, but treated her with antibiotics for cellulitis and staph infection.

I have a canker sore in my mouth that has been incredibly painful.  It's been annoying me, and I wanted to treat it.  I was somewhat familiar with benzocaine, and I thought it was relatively harmless.  I have gotten it multiple times at the dentist, and I even used a topical benzocaine numbing cream back in undergrad when I closed a heavy door on my toenail.\n\nI thought it was pretty benign stuff, so I ordered it on Amazon.  It was a 20% gel with the trade name \"Anbesol.\"  It said to apply a \"pea-sized amount\" to the affected area.  I was in a lot of pain, so I'd say I probably applied a pea and a half.  I was immediately really surprised how strong it was.  For an OTC product, I didn't expect to feel like I was literally at the dentist's office getting ready for some drilling.  I let it dissolve but then got nervous it was too strong and wiped it off.  I hope I didn't swallow any of it.\n\nI then got curious and started reading about potential benzocaine overdose online.  And I see it's been strongly implicated in methemoglobinemia.  It seems benzocaine encourages the production of methemoglobin over hemoglobin.  Methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen as effectively, and a high amount of it can severely reduce the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues.\n\nAm I really at risk for getting methemoglobinemia?  It's been about an hour since I took it.  I am concerned something could happen.  I've read that the onset is generally about two hours, so will I likely be ok if I do not develop symptoms by then?

{"query_id": "35", "query": "I am 27 year old male.  I am actually a medical student, so feel free to give a detailed explanation.\n\nI did something pretty stupid.  I have a canker sore in my mouth that has been incredibly painful.  It's been annoying me, and I wanted to treat it.  I was somewhat familiar with benzocaine, and I thought it was relatively harmless.  I have gotten it multiple times at the dentist, and I even used a topical benzocaine numbing cream back in undergrad when I closed a heavy door on my toenail.\n\nI thought it was pretty benign stuff, so I ordered it on Amazon.  It was a 20% gel with the trade name \"Anbesol.\"  It said to apply a \"pea-sized amount\" to the affected area.  I was in a lot of pain, so I'd say I probably applied a pea and a half.  I was immediately really surprised how strong it was.  For an OTC product, I didn't expect to feel like I was literally at the dentist's office getting ready for some drilling.  I let it dissolve but then got nervous it was too strong and wiped it off.  I hope I didn't swallow any of it.\n\nI then got curious and started reading about potential benzocaine overdose online.  And I see it's been strongly implicated in methemoglobinemia.  It seems benzocaine encourages the production of methemoglobin over hemoglobin.  Methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen as effectively, and a high amount of it can severely reduce the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues.\n\nAm I really at risk for getting methemoglobinemia?  It's been about an hour since I took it.  I am concerned something could happen.  I've read that the onset is generally about two hours, so will I likely be ok if I do not develop symptoms by then?  I've also read that a lot of the cases of this are in infants given benzocaine during teething.  Is this unlikely given the fact that I'm a ~200 lb 27 year old?\n\nAny thoughts would be helpful.  It's very surprising they do not list this on the label of these medications.  There literally are no warnings whatsoever.  When looking this up, one of the top results was a class action lawsuit for failure to adequately warn consumers about this.  Maybe I'm being a little paranoid, but this was definitely a surprise to read about.

Like when a cat scratched my arms or a dog scratched my arms with his teeth, or other kinds of minor wounding. It takes a long time for the discolouration to disappear entirely and the wound to not be visible anymore. Example: while playing with my parents' dog he scratched my right arm with his paws. There was initially a bit of swelling but that disappeared quickly. However, even though it is about a month ago, I can still see the lines in my skin, and they weren't deep at all. There was barely any blood.\n\nIt's not just that I am so bothered by what appears to be slower wound healing. I think it's odd, and I'm wondering whether it can be a signal or symptom of some issue.

The urologist says it's bacterial or fungal, but there's no way to know for sure. He prescribed nystatin cream again and also bactrim.  I'm to take both simultaneously. The dermatologist says it's neither fungal nor bacterial nor viral, it's just \"irritation that comes with age because the skin disintegrates as you get older\" and that I need to get circumcised, he has a friend who does it, and that he sees 5+ patients a day with this issue, and it's never fungal or bacterial. I find what the dermatologist said to be quite odd and I certainly don't want to chop off my foreskin. All say that there's no test to determine what the cause is. I find it so difficult to believe that in 2021 we can't solve this. My father is 92 years old, fought in Korea where he didn't shower or bathe for months, and he's never had this issue.

After every section with meaningful information I've included a small TLDR just because eeehhhh this is quite a bit of text. If you've read even this far, I am so greatful for you. Thank you.\n\n**INFORMATION ABOUT ME:** I'm a caucasian, 17 year old female from Finland. I am 158 cm/ 5'2\" tall and weigh around 70 kg/154 lb. Financially we are struggling, but we can afford the public healthcare just fine. Rarely drink alcohol, no other usuage of drugs etc. If you asked my doctor about my medical condition, she would take a long pause and then say she doesn't really know the whole picture, but something is definitely wrong.Looking at family background, my mother's side has a lot type 1 diabetes and while I don't know a lot about my father's side, I know all of his siblings and their children have ADHD and asperger's while I seem to have neither. I'm currently on birth control pills and medication for depression, both for 2-3 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION:** During the past couple of years I've been getting more and more unexplainable symptoms. They are all over the place, concerning at least my nerves and joints, but most likely also my blood, bones, autoimmune system, brain and digestive system. They started getting aggressively worse 7-8 months ago, and ever since that I've had regular visits with my local doctor, regular blood work checkups, an ultrasound, thoracic (lung) radiographies and most recently a few days ago, a bone marrow biopsy. The only real progress we've made is with my bloodwork, constantly showing the same abnormalities specified later.\\^ TLDR: Multiple different symptoms have been bothering me for years, getting worse 8 months ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FINLAND AND DOCTORS:** Finland is a great country to live in, don't get me wrong. I know there are multiple countries and multiple people who have an even worse situation and I'm not trying to say otherwise. However I live in an extremely small town, which has it's good and bad sides. I can get 45 minutes of time from my local doctor almost any day I need it, and all the staff at our local clinic knows my situation and does their best to help me.\n\nIt's just that they can't do a lot. Once a month or so they take some blood and every monday it's sent off to the bigger city. My doctor can monitor my symptoms but after that all she can do is send me to another doctor which will take months, and since my symptoms are so episodic, this can turn out to be problematic. Private clinics would have times in weeks if not days, but we can't really afford that.\\^ TLDR: Finland is good, just a bit slow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PROBLEMS STARTING IN CHILDHOOD:** I was an extremely clumsy child. Not in a cute way, in a way where I would break all of my teeth and constantly have bruises just from carefully playing. I have never broken a bone or really gotten seriously injured, since I have always been extremely careful to a point where I have missed out on a lot of things because of it. I think it's mostly a mix of me having terrible balance and a lacking depth perception. Also, extremely low pain tolerance.\\^ TLDR: Bad balance and depth perception.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GROWING UP:** I was a really tall child, having rapid growth burts. This would also cause my spine to go real roller coastery real fast. I had pretty severe scoliosis, and after I turned 9 and moved to a bigger school with actual healthcare they started ping ponging me to the big hospital and back, deciding if something should be done about it or not. When I turned 11, I had a huge growth burst of 8 cm/ 3.1\", and after that, I literally stopped growing. Less than one cm in 6 years after that, sooo my roller coaster spine was left alone and didn't really bother me then. Yeah, now it does.\n\nThen a weird thing. It turned out I was actually missing most of baby or adult teeth, depending on how you look at it I guess. I only shed my upper central incisors, one upper canine and one lower canine. The upper ones grew primary teeth, but it turned out there just wasn't any developement for primary teeth elsewhere in my mouth. While researching the correct terms I figured it's actually not that rare to have this with 1 or 2 teeth, but almost all of them? Yikes. Also, my dentists had never seen it and were extremely confused.\\^ TLDR: My spine and teeth hate their lives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MIDPOINT NOTES:** With these more \"normal\" things out of the way, let's dive deeper. Yeah, that's just the beginning.\n\nI had to choose what flair to use, since my problems fall under several of them. This also made me think if I should go through my problem as a timeline or as groups, and ended up with the group approach. I will try to make it clear when everything happened and might end up making an actual timeline drawing at some point, maybe it will help me too.\n\nFrom this point forward, I have no actual way of telling what is connected and what is just coinsidence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BLOOD WORK:** Let's start with the simple things, my blood work. I now noticed they're not as regularly taken as I remember, but that's fine. There are three main things my doctors are worried about, and that have been kept track of because of that. The problem is, in Finland we have completely different names for them, but I tried my best with google. There's C-reactive protein (P-CRP), Lymphocyte (B-leuk) and thrombocyte (B-Trom). My mother recalls her sister had high thrombocyte levels growing up, but we're not sure. Anyway, I made a fast obnoxiously colored chart with all the \"important\" blood work available [here]( as blood work 1 and blood work 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NERVES:** The first really serious symptom I had was nerve damage. Around the spring of 2017 I started having pain in my left elbow, that radiated through my wrist to my fingers. It got worse on the daily until one day I just woke up with absolutely no feeling on the outer side of my hand. My pinkie was completely numb, ring finger partually. The outer part of my palm under the fingers had reduced feeling. Since this explanation is kind of clumsy, in the previous imgur also available [here]( is an image (nerves 1).\n\nWhen the summer holiday ended, I finally got a doctor's appointment and immediately got sent to a childrens hand and nerve specialist. After about 7 months of living in constant level 4-5 pain, I finally got an appointment with a doctor who could actually help me. She immediately scheluded surgery in January without any diagnosis or further tests. Yes, she said it's most likely nerve compression, but nothing more official.\n\nSo the surgery comes and when I wake up, I actually do feel my hand and the constant pain is gone. The surgery was supposed to take about an hour, but ended up taking almost 5 and I never got a proper explanation as of to why, apart from that she had to cut/grind/whet/whatever term is correct for smoothing off a part of my bone. Recovery went fine, but after the pain killers wore off, the pain came back. Now it wasn't constant 4, it was occasional 5 or 6. The hand is still pretty much useless: It has no muscle mass and a lot of everyday tasks hurt, but I'm used to it now. The worst part is, after the surgery if anything touches the spot on my elbow pictured on nerves 2, it's literally the worst pain I can imagine. Sometimes the similar pain happens when I just straighten out the arm. If the bone marrow biopsy was level 7 pain, I would completely honestly say that touching my elbow is worse. I've heard 8 is the pain level of child birth, so I really don't want to go that high, but it feels like it. Reminder, I have very low pain tolerance, and even hugging often hurts.\n\nUnfortunately about 6 months later similar symptoms started in my right arm. Until this day it still hasn't done the complete numbness-trick, but is constantly hurting, has no muscle mass and just kind of hangs around. I've had to take multiple hour long breaks during writing this just because my fingers will stop functioning.\n\nThat's another thing. Along with the pain, the nerve damage has caused my fingers to not function too well. I literally can't control my ring finger on it's own, it will just follow my pinky that also is hard to control. Due to the lack of muscle mass, holding things is already difficult, but add on to that 2/5 fingers just doing whatever they please, and it's pretty annoying to be honest.\\^ TLDR: My both hands have nerve damage, most likely ulnar nerve compression caused by one bone being too large.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BACK AND LUNGS:** The scoliosis has started creeping up on me. To put it lightly, I'm skewed. Lopsided. Crooked. Not straight at all. Funnily enough, you can mostly notice this when I have a ponytail: My head is always so much tilted/skewed to the left that the ponytail is also always hanging on my shoulder. This has led to a situation where my upper neck and lower back are both extremely painful. Compared to the hand pain, it's a different pain. While nerve bain is stabbing and radiating, the back pain is just a constant weight that slowly makes it harder and harder to breathe.\n\nThe only thing that doesn't hurt my back is lying down. This might explain some of my extra weight: Even sitting is painful. I work very hard to keep myself out of bed, but for example in school I have to take a a break once every hour to go to the bathroom just to lie on the floor. Unhygienic for sure, but also the greatest relief ever.\\^ TLDR: If I sit or stand, by back will start hurting in about 20 minutes so bad I feel like I can't breathe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**START OF \"EPISODES\"**: About 7 months ago I got a pretty mild case of angina or tonsillitis. Nothing major, got it from my mom who works in a daycare, went with her to get antibiotics from our local clinic.\n\nUntil this day, our best guess is that this started it all. We don't know how, or why, but after this disease most of my absolutely unexplainable symptoms started. What do I mean by unexplainable? Well.\n\nAfter I got the antibiotics for the angina, everything was fine for about a week until the treatment ended. A few days before that I had what we then assumed was a yeart infection. I had never had one before, my doctor said the symptoms checked out and I got treated for that. The symptoms didn't go away as soon as  they should've, but maybe in \\~10 days. I was kind of busy with the section below so it went unnoticed.\n\n**JOINTS:** Just days after the yeast infection I noticed some weird rashes on my elbows. Also, surprisingly included in the mega bomb of pictures [here]( are the two pictures of my elbows. The rash was mostly red dots, not painful or itchy unless you touched it. One of them developed some yellow in the center. It was symmetric all along my body, starting in elbows, then showing up in knees and ankles. Always on both sides at the same time. This on it's own wouldn't be too concerning, but the next day all of the spots with rash were also extremely swollen, hot, red and painful. I could barely walk. That's when the first blood test with the highest infection count was taken, and when it passed in a few days before I could get to someone who knows about rashes or joints, we just ruled it as some kind of joint infection most likely caused by some autoimmune reaction.\n\nIt has happened 3 times since, every single time being extremely painful, scary and going away within a week. However we have found no actual explanation for it. My doctor said they tested for Rheumatoid arthritis, but can't rule it out.\\^TLDR: After getting angina, I started having episodes where my autoimmune system seems to attack itself, causing mostly joint centered problems.\n\n**\"IN MY HEAD\"/MENTAL SYMPTOMS:** There are multiple symptoms that affect me mentally, the strongest one being tiredness. Always during these \"episodes\" and sometimes outside of them, I'm so tired I will fall asleep sitting on the bus even if I slept a normal amount before it. I will just sleep and sleep and sleep, no matter what I do. I just actually can't stay awake. I usually have a slight fever, but nothing to be worried about. At a point I was admitted to the hospital because I literally slept 23 hours and didn't wake up even when I wet myself, which I have never done after being a toddler. After sleeping there for another 18 hours I woke up slightly less tired and was finally sent home with no answers.\n\nIn the past few months I've also started stuttering and having brain fog. If I'm actively in a conversation, I will stutter once every 2-5 minutes, and sometimes I will stutter the same word closer to 10 times before finally getting over it. I never before have stuttered at all, so this is weird and annoying.\n\nWith the brain fog, it seems to be mostly when I get up and start moving after being inactive for a while. For example in the morning when I leave for school, or when I after class get up. It's not every time and is always not related to activity, but just thought I'd point it out. I feel like my head is just... not functioning properly. Everything feels extremely slow and fast at the same time and for the first time in my life, I've experienced trouble focusing. Sometimes I also experience blurry vision or dizzyness at the same time, but not sure if there is a connection or not.\n\nI have yet to talk about these to any doctor, just my school nurse, who didn't seem too concerned. However to me, they are really just hard to deal with.\\^TLDR: My head is sometimes foggy, dizzy and almost always tired.\n\n**DIGESTIVE SYSTEM:** In the past few years eating has become sort of difficult. I usually eat a light breakfast around 6, then either in school at 12 or when I get home at 15. Sometimes I will eat a heavier meal in the evening, sometimes another light one like bread. I have always functioned like this, and most days I'm fine like that.\n\nHowever these changes have made it so I can't really eat. In school I'm more often hungry, but when I go to eat I will feel full after literally eating a few bites. Some days it will be even worse, and when I get home I will again be really hungry but unable to eat without feeling sick. More often than not I can still eat a normal amount for me, but I really hate the days when my stomach just decides it doesn't want food.\n\nI've had some weeks where I often throw up for no explanation, but I can also keep some food down and don't feel otherwise sick.\n\nOn a more unpleasent note, I've also been suffering with constipation a lot. I've always been kind of a seldom pooper, maybe 1-2 times a week. However this autumn I had a 2 month period where I pooped twice. I tried taking stool softeners and laxatives but there was literally no effect, until my doctor gave me a stronger one that worked after about a week. After that it's been a bit rarer than usual, maybe once every two weeks, but luckily not as bad. The stool is actually not even all that hard, big or painful, it just feels like it doesn't really move all that fast while in there.\\^TLDR: I can't eat normal portion sizes most days. Also had bad constipation.\n\n**TOLERANCE/LOW EFFECTIVENESS:** Another thing that might or might not be related to the digestive system. I have a high tolerance for many substances. Actually I'm not really sure if it's as much high tolerance as it's just that they take a very long time to effect, if they do at all. While \"substances\" sounds rather illegal, I'm actually talking about sedatives and caffeine. Because I'm so sensitive to pain, I often get sedatives before dentists or in this example, the bone marrow biopsy. During the first 3 times I got it at the dentists, I got it 30 minutes before as recommended, since it should start effecting you in about 20 minutes. However it actually started effecting me once I got home, almost 1,5 hours later. Last time I got a slightly stronger sedative an hour before and it worked much better.\n\nWhen it comes to caffeine, I don't have this scientific amounts to give, but it has never really affected me in any way. While my mom has always started feeling bad after just half a cup of coffee or an energy drink, neither affect me at all, even in bigger quantities. I have never drank more than 2 energy drinks at a time, but felt absolutely no difference.\n\nAnd then there's alcohol. I first started drinking alcohol about 6 months ago, in a safe environment in small quantities. When the 3rd time came around, I had still never even felt tipsy. My boyfriend weighs a noticeable amount more than me, and so do many other men there. They are all also more used to alcohol. I wanted to feel something, so I started drinking shots with one of them. He's older than me, bigger than me and more used to alcohol, being one of the biggest drinkers there. I outdrank him and while I felt slightly tipsy after that, he threw up.\n\nOn New years eve I decided to take a bit more, and was honestly shocked at home much I could drink without any problems. A lot of the guys that didn't know me were so sure that I'd throw up any minute and kept giving me shots, and but I was fine. The only \"drunk\" thing I did all night was forgetting my phone in the bedroom, which is rare for me. When we got home I started feeling slightly weird, but that was literally 6 hours after I stopped drinking.\n\nMy mom and everyone else is super confused about this, calling it my \"unuseful superpower\". Honestly it just bothers me. I hate feeling like there's something wrong with me. I would just like to add that I am still drinking responsibly and there's no need to worry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AUTOIMMUNE:** Everyone's best guess at this point is some kind of autoimmune disease that we just can't lock down, so we're trying to slowly rule out other possibilities. I just have a lot of symptoms that are kind of random but could definitely be explained by the body attacking itself, like constant fatigue and tiredness, muscle/joint/nerve pain and stiffness, slighty higher than normal hair loss and low fevers from time to time. One peculiar symptom is canker sores or mouth ulcers that always come at the same time as other symptoms, sometimes making my mouth hurt so bad I can't eat for days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION:** I'm almost certain I missed something, and I will be editing and adding them in. I thank everyone that read even a small portion of this, even if you don't know what could be going on with me. I'm just honestly tired of this. I miss drawing, playing the piano and having a normal life.\n\nI'm going out of city for the weekend so I will be answering on mobile as best as I can, if I still remember the password for this account. Let's pray I can post in all the subs with negative karma, I'm at -2 at the moment for pissing off a videogame subreddit by suggesting some changes.\n\nI probably should've waited the few weeks until I get the results of the bone marrow test, but I'm too sick of living like this.

I thought a huge bee somehow got inside my head, it was that loud. About 20 minutes later, it happened again. But I had earplugs in, the second time, so I knew it wasn't a bug. This was around 8pm that day. I did two things earlier that day, that I'm not sure had anything to do with it:\n\n1. Around 12pm, I watched this Andrew Huberman video about increasing your range of motion by increasing your range of vision. I think I might have misunderstood it? But I was practicing my splits and instead of keeping my head facing forward, I turned around as far as I could and physically pushed my eyes to look as far as I could behind me. Sorry if that sounds so idiotic haha I'm sure I misunderstood what he was saying, but anyway that's what I did. I felt my eyes straining. I held it for about 60 seconds on each side. \n\n2. I met with my contortion coach online at 1pm. We worked on backbends (and neck and shoulder warmups) for the whole hour. I specifically asked her to help me with my neck placement because I could finally see my feet, while in a backbend position.  So we practiced a lot of \"elongating\" neck movements, up and down. I felt really good after class. \n\nSo when I got that buzz (hours later) and looked it up, people said it sounded like tinnitus. But it was hours after practicing. I emailed my coach to ask her (she is a doctor of physical therapy) and her first thought was that it could be from a fall or something to do with chewing? She said she didn't think it had anything to do with backbends. \n\nBut I didn't practice at all anyway, since last Tuesday. And today I practiced again... did some backbends, but only like 3. And I got that same really loud buzz in my right ear again (and hours later again). \n\nI'm freaking out because online it says that could be from a neck or head injury, but I just moved so I don't have health insurance yet :( \n\n\n(Last Wednesday night, my right eye was bouncing a lot after I laid down to go to bed, too). That was the only time that happened, but wasn't sure if they were connected. That's why I mentioned the video I watched about range of vision. I'm wondering if I actually injured myself from doing that, since my coach doesn't think it's from backbending? \n\nI'm just not sure if I should freak out or not because Google says tinnitus in one ear is cause for concern but I can't go to a doc for weeks :( if anyone has any ideas, I'd appreciate it so much!!!

Moreover, it has been difficult to establish an optimal treatment strategy for postpubertal cryptorchidism, given the small number of patients. Unlike cryptorchidism in children, postpubertal cryptorchidism is associated with an increased probability of neoplasms, which has led orchiectomy to be the recommended treatment.
