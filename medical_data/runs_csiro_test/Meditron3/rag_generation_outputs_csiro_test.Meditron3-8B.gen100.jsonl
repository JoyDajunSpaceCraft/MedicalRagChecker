It’s been a long, 15 year  journey with my skin issues and I’m feeling hopeless this evening because through it all, I feel like I have made no real progress. \n\nI have acne, and I’m a 33 year old Caucasian female with fair, freckled combination skin. My acne started to get really bad about 10 years ago. I’ve tried numerous skincare routines/topical treatments. They didn’t work (although I’m not giving up on that front). Was on Minocycline for 2 years which initially worked somewhat, but it started declining in effectiveness after a year and eventually just stopped working entirely. Next, was Doxycycline which gave me the worst, month long yeast infection I’ve ever had and didn’t do much for my skin. \n\nFrom there - I stopped all acne medications for about 6 months in an effort to let my body recover from the 2 years of daily antibiotics, and let my skin go through whatever it needed to go through off meds in hopes it would clear up (naive aspirations...). I was hanging in there after 5 months of being med-free, until I picked up some kind of skin bacteria or fungus when I went camping. I had dry looking red patches on my face and In my scalp that itched. \n\nMy doctor wasn’t exactly sure what it was, but she prescribed me Bactrim. The minute I heard she was prescribing me another stronger antibiotic, I knew right away that it was going to clear my skin and got this guilty, excited feeling like the acne med junkie that I am. Well- I was right....it cleared up the mystery dry itchy spots on my face and hair(although one of the bigger mystery patches left a pretty sizable scar which was jolting), but it also just so happened to clear my entire face better than ANYTHING ever tried before. \n\nFor the first time in 10 years, I had next to 100% clear, glowing skin. It was such a good feeling. I could go makeup free for the first time in my life. The taste of freedom was too good, though... because I basically became addicted to Bactrim. I managed to get a couple more prescriptions for it and have been abusing the medication for 10 months, dragging out these last pills I have by taking half of a 75mg Bactrim (1/4 of the prescribed daily amount) per day. I know what I’m doing is not healthy or smart and I don’t want to cause a mutant bacteria growth/resistance within my system so I am stopping, this week. \n\nMy questions are - why are antibiotics the only thing that clears my skin? What does that say about my system and overall health? That I need to work on my gut flora/General gut health? Even the Bactrim at this point is starting to decline in effectiveness, the same issue with antibiotics in general.\n\nSome more info about my acne: I get all types of blemishes - closed commodones, blackheads, cystic acne and whiteheads, all over my face. The closed comodones are mainly on my forehead and jawline, cystic on my cheeks and cheekbones and also my chin, whiteheads pop up everywhere randomly, and in the last 2 years there’s been a surge of blackheads that come up literally all over my whole face. I’ve never had this many issues before. (The last time I saw my skin at its worst was 10 months ago before I started Bactrim) It got really bad before I started taking Bactrim and I’m dreading what I might be going through again. \n\nIm also worried about scarring - I’m 33 and my skin is not recovering from scarring as well as it used to. Lastly, diet info: I’ve ruled dairy out as a trigger by eliminating it from my diet for 2 months and seeing no improvement. And I am about to do the same with sugar.

About three years ago, he had acute pancreatitis that led him to more seriously work on sobriety. He was mostly successful but had a brief relapse that lead to another acute pancreatitis about two years ago. Again, focused on sobriety but every couple of months would have a single-day relapse. Last year, his mother died from multi-organ failure d/t alcoholism, and he hasn't had a drink since. Despite that, he has had near constant digestive issues. Frequent vomiting. Frequent diarrhea. Could barely eat anything. I long suspected he was having ascites d/t an increasing abd girth despite eating less than a 1000 calories a day for months, but his lab values came back normal. We went to the doctor constantly but they would just give him more ondansetron with instructions to avoid fatty foods.\n\nBut about 3 months ago, I noticed he was gaining MORE weight and he was developing jaundice. Went to the hospital, and he had developed acute liver failure. The weird part- MRI showed NO cirrhosis. He was in the hospital for almost a week before they dc'd with instructions that were basically...more rest. His doctors didn't know the cause of the liver failure, but assumed because there was no cirrhosis and no evidence of cancer, he would recover. His edema became so severe he was struggling to breathe but his doctors just told him to rest more. Two weeks ago, he collapsed after getting up from the toilet and struck his head, and I called an ambulance to be safe. His K+ was 2.4. Biliruben had skyrocketed. They finally did a paracentesis and drained 4.8L. His breathing was much better, and they put him on spironolactone and furosemide.

Meds: None.\n\nI keep hearing that getting a certain amount of sleep per night (I think it's 8) is vital for mental health, and that being sleep deprived creates all kinds of issues for mental health (I have seen quite a few posts on reddit lately along those lines) \n\nFor years I have had very poor 'waterworks' which cause me to have to use the toilet many times a night.  I estimate roughly that I don't get more than 3 hours sleep between visits to the toilet.   I *have* tried to get help for this from my GP more than once but I am deeply disappointed in the 'help' they provide (One:  Get tests done,  tests come back normal, end of story.  Two:  \"Drink less coffee\")\n\nMy worry is that although I *might* be getting somewhere around 6 to 8 hours of sleep if I'm lucky,  I'm *never* getting that much *uninterrupted* sleep.\n\nSo my question is,  does it count as 8 hours if I've woken up say 3 to 5 times to go to the toilet?\n\nAs it happens I have been struggling mentally since about August (I visited the doc a few weeks after that started, and was offered anti-depressants,  refused them because I consider them a last resort and don't want to become reliant... Was also told where I live simply doesn't have the resources for one-on-one therapy),  but my poor sleep has been an issue for a *lot* longer than that.\n\n**Edit**:  Thank you for all the replies.  I did not expect to get that many!   I don't have time to reply to them all right now (though I may reply to some when I get time to read through them again)   There is a lot of support for antidepressants so I will reconsider them.

What tests have you had done?\n\nNow, to answer your question: sleep comes in a cycle with four stages, and these stages repeat several times during the night. Each cycle lasts from 90 minutes to 120 minutes. Once you wake up you have to go through all the stages again. Depending on which stage of these cycles your sleep is interrupted, you may wake up feeling very groggy, and repeated interruptions are scientifically proven to have an impact in long-term mental and physical health.

No pertinent family history except my dad has arthritis and psoriasis, and I have PCOS.\n\nQuite a long story, so bear with me. If you're interested in a difficult case, this one's for you.\n\nA month ago, I had lunch with some friends and ate a lot of dim sum. The dimsum was mostly steamed dumplings and noodles, nothing raw to my knowledge. Everyone else I ate with is also perfectly fine. I felt extremely bloated, and even after walking around all day after, the feeling didn't go away. The day after, I started getting some aching epigastric pain. It would happen before eating, and I would feel very bloated after eating anything. I assumed it was Gerd or gastritis, and took famotidine, Tums, omeprazole, none of which helped. I wasn't able to eat anything more than a few bites every meal, because of how full I felt. I went to the ER 3 days later, and they misdiagnosed me with cholecystitis. In the ER, my platelet count was low (93), hemoglobin and rbc low (10.3 and 3.19), bilirubin was high (1.8) but my white blood cell count was normal. They gave me Flagyl and Cipro to take, which actually stopped the pain but I also was on a liquid-only diet at this point.\n\nA week later, I went to a different hospital near my hometown. Was diagnosed with hepatosplenomegaly. My liver is currently 26.3 cm in craniocaudal dimension, spleen is 20.1cm. Did ultrasounds, a CT, and an MRI. Found nothing remarkable, except for a huge liver and spleen.\n\nIt's been a month now, and my symptoms are the same, except for darkened petechiae on my face and neck from low platelets. I've also been getting hot flashes and Charley horses at night. My bilirubin is now 2.2, and my liver and spleen are still enlarged. I'm still anemic. I've seen a gastroenterologist, an internist, a hepatologist, and have done tons of bloodwork and stool tests, with nothing remarkable. Mono was suspected for the longest time, but my tests were negative. Also ruled out Wilson's, lupus, hepatitis. My physician wants to do a liver biopsy next, but I doubt they will find anything there either.\n\nI'm honestly so tired of being tired all day and not having a treatment for this. No one can seem to figure out what's causing this, and it is not improving on its own. I can only walk for \\~30 minutes without feeling exhausted, still can't eat much, and feel full all the time.

You should have had about 100 tests and it sounds like you have -- but without seeing all of those we can't really comment too much. For example have you had all cases of viral hepatitis excluded? Ok, how about more rare infections? What imaging have you had? MRCP to rule out a plumbing issue in the biliary tree? How about an ERCP? Your low platelets and hepatosplenomegaly make me worry about cirrhosis, but I know nothing of your risk factors for cirrhosis nor if you've been tested for fibrosis in the liver. Basic takeaway: reddit is not the right place for you to get an answer, most likely. Find a good gastroenterologist/hepatologist and go from there. If your workup has been thorough so far, a liver biopsy might be a good idea for you -- if you have cirrhosis you need to know and it also may give an idea of why.

As title says, during the past 2 years, I have had over 20 abscesses (more than 1 inch) surgically removed. These abscesses never form a head and they lie under my skin, so there's no way I pop them or whatever, it needs to be opened surgically. These abscesses are so painful that I can't do anything regularly. I can't have a normal job, I couldn't go to school properly, I was always either depressed about one that was forming or in so much pain that I couldn't move properly. Most of these occur in my buttcheeks but I've had one in the back of my head, one in my armpit and recently I had two big ones in each side of my scrotum area (which was by far the most complicated ones to remove, I had to be hospitalized for 2 days each and put on general/spinal anesthesia). The ones on my buttcheeks and armpit were removed as soon as I went into ER and I didn't need to stay the night at the hospital. I stopped getting them like 3 months ago but suddenly I got 3 of them... yes, three at the same time. Two on each side of my buttcheeks and one on the side of my scrotum, so basically I cannot sit/stand/walk without pain. All of them have been surgically removed but I am still in pain because of the packing and removing/inserting wick daily which is insanely painful.\n\nDoctors have no idea what it is, they always tell me it's an ingrown hair or it's in my genetics that there's no cure or something like that. They just gave me antibiotics and they are done with me until the next time. I've never had pus tested until I had to beg the doctor to test. I've had my blood tested, no diabetes, normal chlolesterol, etc.. During my last visit to the operating theatre, I begged the doctor to take a pus swab to see if we can find a way to end this but I don't know if this will help at all but we'll get the results in 3 weeks. I don't know what type of infection/disease I have. I have been researching the internet and I've found about MRSA and HS but I don't know if this is my diagnosis. I literally don't know what to do guys, I am depressed because I know I'll get more of these, they won't stop until I find the cause. Everytime one starts to form, I take a trip to the hospital and I've been put on amoxicillin 1000/ciproquin and metronidazole so many times, they don't work but they give it to me even if I tell them that they don't work and I always have to end up waiting for it to get bigger so that I can have it surgically removed. This is a very painful condition and when I got 3 at the same time, I was preparing for an interview that I really needed as I need a job badly but unfortunately I was hospitalized. I've been having suicidal thoughts because I literally cannot do anything good with my life right now, tired of being in pain, tired of not having a job, tired of everything.

When I arrived, I saw my wife's hands and freaked out a bit. Her hands had swollen to almost twice their normal size. She had redness and blisters spreading down her hands and arms. \n\n  Within a few days, the redness and swelling showed up on her chest as well. I took her to the emergency room twice in Corpus Christi, and twice in our home town as well. The doctors at he hospital initially thought it was a sunburn that was very bad. Her hands reacted horribly to the cream and treatment given to her. The welling got worse and we lost sight of her knuckles completely. By the time we got back home and I took her to the hospital she was vomiting and running a high fever. \n\n The doctors at home still didn't know what it was, but treated her with antibiotics for cellulitis and staph infection. She was given a huge round of steroids as well. The swelling eventually faded, and the blisters went away as well. However since then her hands have stopped getting better. \n\n Now is where I really need the help.... Her hands continue to get red if she uses them for anything. Cooking, cleaning, holding things (even as simple as a piece of paper). If she goes ok complete bed rest her hands will get less red, but still won't completely improve. Her hands seem to have their own temperature. They feel like they have a fever isolated in them when the rest of her body is a normal temperature. If she uses her hands the redness comes fully back and she gets extreme pain in her hands that will last though out the night. Even going as far as waking her up from a dead sleep. \n\n  We've had two biopsies on both hands now. Many rounds of blood tests. All the tests show negative for lupus or other auto immune diseases. The biopsies show signs of inflammation, but no one can seem to give us an answer as to what the root cause may be or how to treat it going forward. The real problem here is that she has never had anything like this before, and it has completely stunted her ability to live normally. \n\n  I'm trying to help pick up the slack for her at home, but she ends up feeling guilty and starts doing things again. This only serves to make the situation worse. I'm worried about the long term effects since no one can seem to tell us what this was or is and how to deal with it.

Certainly, the reduction of the infectious period (usually, it is said that a patient is no longer infectious 24 hours after the initiation of antibiotics) is important. However, the main reason behind the treatment of strep throat is the reduction of something called _acute rheumatic fever_ (ARF) which leads to _rheumatic heart disease_ (RHD).\n\nBriefly RHD is an injury to the valves of the heart that causes life-long disability.

No one knows why.\n\nI've just returned from my obgyn after discovering a rather \"rough\" patch of skin on my **inner left labia**, which has never happened. When I say rough, I mean it feels like someone ripped the skin open. It hurts when I touch it, so naturally, I immediately went to see my obgyn for it. She went through my recent lab results (one week old) with me and took a look at everything. This rough patch of skin is near the glands, she said, but not directly at the same spot. She suspects that it might be HPV (aka warts) in a veeeery early stage. She has now given me the address of a specialist that I will see for this issue. I will see this specialist in February, they don't have any free slots before that.

Yet my gyn says that he doesn’t think it’s the cause.\n\nCan someone please give a second opinion?\n\nFor reference, my pain is a deep, almost bruise-like pain that occurs with deep penetration. It does not hurt with all types of penetration (e.g. tampons are fine), it’s just when certain areas are pressed on. It never hurts unless it’s actively being provoked.\n\nPrevious tests:\n\nI had an exploratory laparoscopy that was completely clean and ruled out endometriosis. I had a cystoscopy with hydrodistension that showed bleeding (don’t remember the technical term) and led to a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis, though I didn’t see any improvement in the pain with medications for that (I tried several), and I also don’t deal with other typical IC issues (frequency, urgency, etc). I did pelvic floor therapy for six weeks, where they told me from the beginning that I had a strong kegel and a strong relax, and I didn’t see any improvement over six weeks (my gyn was not surprised by this since he said there were not any noticeable issues with my pelvic floor function). Various other scans have not shown any other issues (cysts, fibroids, etc). Birth control greatly manages my periods, but it has no effect on the pain with sex (tried several kinds). I’ve tried muscle relaxants, anti-depressants for nerve pain, topical lidocaine, and the old “have a glass of wine first” strategy. Nothing has made any difference.\n\nIf it’s relevant, I also have EDS (hypermobile type) and Sjogren’s Syndrome, though my doctors don’t seem to think those are related.

Although medical therapies may improve deep dyspareunia in women with endometriosis, laparoscopic excision of deep endometriotic lesions has been demonstrated to improve not only deep dyspareunia but also the quality of sex life. Deep dyspareunia related to the presence of pelvic congestion syndrome should be treated by pelvic vein embolization.
